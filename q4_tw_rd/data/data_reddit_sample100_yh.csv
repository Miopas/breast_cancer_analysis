bibimbapcouch,1601069940,"This past month has been super stressful. Last month, I (19F) found a small, \~2cm lump on my right breast, very close to my nipple. It's not visible, but it is palpable. There was slight pain that comes an goes, but that was about it. I did not hesitate and immediately scheduled an appointment to get it checked.  
My doctor gave me a physical breast exam and told me that ""it does not feel concerning"" because she could barely feel it herself. However, she still referred me to get an ultrasound since it was hurting.

A few days after my exam, the pain seemed to go away. Two weeks later, I had my ultrasound. I got my ultrasound results last week. In my ultrasound report, it stated that I had a ""hypoechoic mass with an irregular shape and irregular border 1.5x2.3x1.8, Bi-Rads 4A: Suspicious irregular abnormality, biopsy recommended."" Reading that, I immediately panicked and scheduled my biopsy right away.

The days leading up to my biopsy, I was super anxious. The words ""irregular"" ""suspicious"" and ""abnormal"" just clouded my mind so much. I kept thinking to myself, *what if I do have cancer?*

I had my biopsy a week after I got my results. I was super nervous about the procedure and how it was gonna feel. From stories that I read online, a lot of people said that there might be a little pain and pressure, but it's not that bad.

I just had my biopsy 2 days ago (9/23). Before my procedure, I asked the doctor about my ultrasound report and if it really looked suspicious. He replied, ""it was actually hard to tell what the lump looked like. Since you're young, you have very dense breasts, so it doesn't show up well on the ultrasound. because of that, we have to do a biopsy."" That response calmed me a bit, but I was also disappointed because I wish the report would have just said that the lump was hard to see, instead of all those scary words.

They did a core needle biopsy + guided ultrasound and it was way worse than I expected. They numbed me w/ local anesthesia, but it wasn't enough. It was super freakin painful and I was crying so much. Every time they turned the vacuum on, I would get shocked by this intense, sharp pain in my nipple. It was borderline torture. my biopsy was also quite long too. They had a hard time trying to collect good samples because my breasts were super dense and the lump kept moving around, so they tried to get several samples (i think they got about 12 samples).

After the biopsy was over, I laughed and cried in relief because that was the most painful procedure I've ever had.

My doctor also said that since they had a hard time getting samples, it might not be good enough for the pathologist to examine. So if that becomes the case, then I'll have to have surgery to get the lump removed and examined. And honestly, I think I would have much preferred that then the biopsy...

So now, it is 2 days after my biopsy and I am awaiting results, which should come within a week. I am extremely anxious. I have no family history of any cancer, but I have a hard time processing the possibility that I could have breast cancer at 19 years old. I know someone who was diagnosed with breast cancer when they were 22, and 19 and 22 aren't that big of an age difference.

I don't know... I am super scared. I will keep you updated soon.",0

throwmeaway212223,1591998963,"My mother (53) was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and upon genetic testing it was discovered she had the BRCA1 mutation. Out of precaution, I (22F) got tested and found out I have the mutation as well. 

Needless to say, I am scared. In addition to my mom, both my grandmothers (maternal and paternal), two of my great grandmothers (both maternal), and one of my cousins on my moms side have all had breast cancer, so I’ve been getting a yearly mammogram since I was 18. I’ve already had two breast biopsies due to lumps appearing concerning on mammograms/ultrasounds (19 and 21). 

I know one of the best ways to take a stance against this mitigation is a preventative mastectomy, but given my age I feel most doctors will be wary of doing one. If any one has words of advice, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Take care, god bless. Much love to you all",0

novella64,1595164329,"My mum passed away last year at 54 she had a 10year battle with breast cancer. She was the strongest person i know, she never let it get in the way. She continued working, was an exec of a national of bank. She had an incredible fighting spirit. She had the surgery, chemo, radiation, therapy multiple seasons of remissions and then it would show up elsewhere. In her last year when she got the stage 4 diagnosis we later found out that she hid it from us, i also had my wedding coming up and i guess she wanted us to just make it through. She passed on two months after the wedding. I have been struggling with understanding why she didnt tell us yet she had been very forth coming about everything from the start of the journey and i felt bad for focusing on the wedding not realizing time wasnt on our side .

Green_boots17,1520541038,"Hello, I am new here so sorry if I am doing this wrong.

I'm looking for comfort, advice and guidance.

Back in 2013, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, shortly before her 50th birthday. She had a mastectomy and started chemo. She was given the all clear the following year.

Then, in early 2016, she was diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer. She had another mastectomy and started hormonal treatment. 

2016 was a bad year for her. She had a lot of pain in her ribs and I kept taking her to A&amp;E and they fobbed her off each time saying it is probably from coughing. She ended up with a kidney infection and was hospitalised. When she was released the doctor told her that her kidney was clear and nothing else was wrong. The rib pain persisted throughout the year and in January 2017 she had scans after complaining for so long. The results were not welcome. She now had metastatic cancer in her ribs and spine and there were unknown masses in her lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. She started more treatment (radiotherapy) and things seemed to be going okay. The masses in her organs and spine disappeared, the ribs stopped growing. Toward the end of 2017, she started getting pain in her hip but thought it felt muscular, rather than bone pain. 

Two weeks ago, the pain became a lot worse and she fell over at work because of it. She had scans as they thought she may have broken something. This was not the case. We had the results today and the cancer has spread. Now it's in her hips, the ribs has spread and it is back in her lungs. We found this out today.

She started a new injection today, which was only approved by medical boards last month in the UK. We have to wait three months for a new scan to see if it is helping. If not, then back to chemo we go.

I am at an absolute loss of what to do, how to feel or what to think.

She is my best friend. The reality that I might lose her in the near future has hit me hard and it feels like my world is crashing around me.

What can I do to make her feel more comfortable / brighten her days? What do I say? How do I cope? 

I'm sorry for the essay. I don't feel like I can talk to someone in my real life. Saying it out loud is so final.",0

foryourbreast,1590857156,"Prompted to write this post u/mayonnaisemonarchy, which told how emotionally difficult it is for people with cancer to be asked to diagnose it in healthy people. In fact, this is a big problem for all of humanity - we are used to asking advice from people who can not help us due to lack of knowledge and skills, but whom we consider to be authorities for some reason. And professionals are often considered only from the point of view of Commerce-ha, if I ask the doctor, he will roll out a bill for 100 dollars, if I go to a specialized service, I will get a bill for minor repairs to my car for 150 dollars, and so on. In my first post on Reddit, I talked about creating a portable breast scanner that, thanks to bioimpedance, can accurately squeak whether you need to panic or not. The project is still in development, but if you want to participate in trial testing, you can leave requests on the site [https://www.portativebreastscanner.com/](https://www.portativebreastscanner.com/)

Together, let's create a unique gadget that will not only help save lives, but also save people with such a strong emotional load from wasting time on diagnostic manipulations.

paranoidaf01,1525867412,"I am 16 years old, birthday is in two months. Around 2 years old my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very tuff and stressful year for myself, my two siblings, my dad and all of our close family and friends, but we managed and she survived a category 5 breast cancer - both boobs removed due to cancer almost about to break through into the rest of her body and due to the fact her breast cancer was so close to her lungs, heart, throat ect they had to go. Two years later she is cancer free, but I don’t feel like our family is fully cancer free just yet. A few days ago I was at my boyfriends getting changed when I noticed my right boob was in pain so I checked out my boob to see it was leaking clear fluid, after a few wtf moments I squeezed it and then came out milky fluid ....(I’m on birth control too- implant aka the bar) ... my boob decided it was gonna leak for two days and so did my pain but when the leaking stopped my boob became much more pain full. As usual I told my mum she checked for lump but found nothing. The night after I checked because I was in way to much pain, I did it probably, right arm over my head and checked, within a few seconds I found a small lump that every time I pressed on it would aggravate the heck out of my boob and would lead me to tears. I told mum she checked but she couldn’t feel it, as I said it hurt if too much pressure was pressed on it but she wasnt pressing hard enough to be able to find it. I know I wasn’t going crazy and was just feeling my tissue, it was just a lump- hard and very hurt full. All day I’ve had to worst anxiety as I did my research to find I have a high chance at being at risk of it because it’s direct into my family jeans, as well as I’ve had a good 10 or more family members died from it since I was born so it’s just a family thing I guess. My boob is constantly hurting, I feel like I’m going to be sick or even faint at some point. I tried to see a doctor but they were closing. I’m in the group on Facebook called girls advice and I said I was in pain but they only took into consideration that my boob was leaking and how I’m pregnant and them being very rude towards me saying “you have a brain you silly girl, so f***ing use it and get a test” so they didn’t help but I need answers, please someone help me I’m in so much pain....

Christinarose88,1602283688,"To sum up what happened to me, about 6 months ago I went in to get an ultrasound of a mass I had in my breast for a few years. I am 20, and I had this mass since I was about 16. For my yearly checkup at my pediatrician, they would always tell me to not worry about it and it was probably a cyst. Fast forward to when I go in to my OBGYN in around february, they are much more concerned and tell me to get an appt. with the imaging center asap.  After the ultrasound we found a 4.5 cm sclerosing mass that looked really nasty on the ultrasound, with a lot of blood flow. (They rated it BI-RADS 4b). Then they got me in for a emergency biopsy within the week. Before the biopsy, they also sent me to a cancer institute and I am also a patient there with a great oncologist (even though I hadn't been diagnosed with cancer). After the core needle biopsy I was told it was a massive sclerosing intraductal papilloma with some atypical features. They recommended I get it removed immediately. So, fast forward to today, I had my 6 month post op (from lumpectomy) with my oncologist. She said she talked to the radiologist and they agreed I should have a check up ultrasound. So now, only 6 months after the removal of the massive papilloma, I have 3 new cysts, (1 is complex) and a new mass about 1cm. They told me to wait 6 months for another ultrasound to see where everything is at. But, I don't know if i feel comfortable with that? I talked to the radiologist and oncologist who both said thats standard protocol. (which i know it is). But, in my case, im only 20 and already had a very odd tumor and now these 4 abnormalities grew in less than 6 months from surgery... The new mass was rated BI-RADS 3.. which i know standard protocol is to re image in 6 months. Should I just wait? Should I push for a biopsy sooner? I'm just nervous and unsure what to do :(",0

The hospital I’m going to is very strict with it’s Covid-19 procedures. The one question I had asked the surgeon was about the Coronavirus. They have zero patients with the virus. That eases my mind quite a bit but I’m still concerned. 

Can any of you tell me what to expect after my surgery? I’m told that if I have no problems or issues, they may send me home the same day. I don’t understand that at all!

I realize that no two surgeries are alike and the healing process is different for everybody. Guess I’m looking for the “cheat codes” to get through this ordeal. What helps ease the pain? What makes the pain worse? Is the surgery spot hard to keep clean? What is the best sleeping position?

She said that I have very dense breasts and that she needs me to go to get an ultrasound immediately. Unfortunately, the hospital she wanted me to go to is the biggest in my state and I have to wait a couple days until I can go in. My doctor fears me having IBC. 

I’m very nervous about this ultrasound. My mom doesn’t know how serious this could be. I downplayed it A LOT so she wouldn’t get worried. Her mother passed away from BC at a very young age so it’s too close to home for her. 

Anyway, how long after the ultrasound will I get results/know if I need a biopsy. Everyone on this page keeps saying how waiting is the hardest part - I believe it. What were your experiences like with ultrasounds and how long did it take to hear anything back? Thank you so much and sending hugs and love to you all!",0

All we've been told so far is that its very early stage and we'll get a full report Monday. I'm hoping that some of you may give me some information on what your caregivers did that helped you or what you wish they did that could have helped you more. 

So far, I've started a log of appointments, doctors names, dates, outcomes, insurance info so we have it readily available. I've put together a list of questions that we should probably ask during appointments. I've started the process at my work of what i need to do to make sure that I can attend all appointments and take time off for whatever treatment may be necessary. Of course there is emotional support and whatever i can do at home/ease at her work while she is working. I've offered to make the needed phone calls to immediate family once we find out what the plan is so she doesn't have to deal with it.  Is there anything that your so's/caregivers did that you really appreciated or anything that you wish they did? Any supplies/stuff to look into that i can have at the ready for her.

aaronpppppp,1550712925,"Hi - sorry for the long questions.  I appreciate any info at all you want to share, thank you all.  

All secondhand so sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.  My friend was diagnosed with metastatic rapid spread breast cancer, a lump the size of maybe a plum and also cancer in her jawbone - she ignored pain for a long time.  She's was doing chemo and radiation on jaw, and now just chemo for the last few months which is was precursor to breast removal and I believe some chest muscle.  That was about 6 months ago.  The latest scans now came back with cancer on liver, chest wall/lungs and spine and doctors will be introducing a new chemo drug for a monthly treatment.

So I've read about life expectancy for this scenario to be  something around 20% over 5 years, and that this diagnosis means basically a life time of checkups, relapses, treatment, set backs, etc.  I understand this and also never waver in being positive with her in that she will beat this.    She never wants to ask prognosis questions with her DRs and I never share what I read even though she understands how serious it is.  I never attend visits with DRs. This is info I will never share with her unless she asks.   I know it's not a fair question of you and guesswork.  But what I am  asking is in your experience in what you went through or your family did, how bad is it honestly with that second cancer discovery with spine, liver and lungs/chest.  That sounds extremely bad to me. Please share anything you can and sorry if I brought up painful memories.  Thank you",0

Beautiful_Midnight88,1552765623,"My main question is whether it is normal for the lymph nodes to be scanned and photographed during an ultrasound looking at a suspicious area after a routine mammogram screening? I'm also wondering if there is anything else about my ultrasound that might raise suspicion. At the moment, I am probably needlessly anxious because I don't feel I have enough knowledge to properly assess the situation. Google is fully providing the information I am looking for.

Some background: I am 30F. My mother's side (French Canadian) has a history of breast cancer, but so far, no gene defect has been found. My mom has 3 sisters. My grandmother (70s), Aunt 2 (48 pre-menopause), Aunt 3 (55) and Aunt 1's daughter, my cousin (40), have all had breast cancer, as well as two of my mom's cousin. I recently saw a genetic counselor, and based on my cousin's age at diagnosis, she recommended I start getting yearly mammograms now. 

I went for my first mammogram on Friday, March 8. When I was called in by the  technician, she asked me all types of questions, including who recommended I get a mammogram. She told me ultrasounds were better at my age because the breasts are so dense. She also told me that I might get a call to come back for further testing before the mammogram was done.

The following Monday, I got a call from the imaging center asking me to schedule a follow up ultrasound. I was not told why, nor did I ask. It worried me a little, but I figured my breasts were just too dense, like the first technician said, so they were playing it safe. The ultrasound was booked for 4 days later.

Yesterday, I went to my appointment. I went in convinced it was just a further routing screening that would probably show nothing. They accidentally skipped me, and my son had an appointment I had to take him to later that afternoon, so it may have been a little rushed. She gave me the gown and left me in the ultrasound room to undress. After I lied down, she I told me it was just for my left breast. I began to worry a little because I was expecting a full scan. I have since read that one breast can be more dense than the other, so perhaps that was the case.

The ultrasound technician started on the top, where she did not take any pictures. Finally, when she got to the bottom of my breast, she started taking pictures. She took many at different angles, beginning with pushing it upwards right against my ribs. She seemed to be aiming at a specific spot. So now I'm thinking there was probably a suspicious area or mass, which I have also read is quite common and usually benign. But at this point during the exam, I start to think the worst.

She then had me turn on my side and took some more pictures of the same area. After that, she began taking pictures more in my armpit. I know that's where they would check lymph nodes, and I know if lymph nodes are involved, the breast cancer would be more progressed. At the time I took this to be very bad. After that she left the room to allow me to get dressed. I quickly looked at the computer screen, which was not visible to me during the exam. I could see that she took 24 pictures, and the last three, which I assume would of been of the lymph nodes, were still displayed. The second last picture had a box around something. I can't remember if there was a visible circular band, but I do know it was white and squiggly.

I left without being told anything. I assume the results will go back to my family doctor, and then they will call me if there is anything to discuss. Unfortunately, the ultrasound was performed on a Friday afternoon, so I wont hear anything until Monday at the very least. I have since felt my left breast from every angle trying to figure out what they were looking at. The problem I have always had with self checking is that I have large breasts and it always feels like there are multiple lumps and areas with substantial tissue. I could find something in the area, but how do I know that isn't just one of my normal lumps? 

To anyone who took the time to read the above novel and provides feedback, you have my utmost gratitude!",0
EveryNameIsTaken314,1578380375,"So, in grade 6, I had gotten my breast cancer shot. Soon after that, I started feeling something in my chest, and I chalked it up to a coincidence, and just told myself that is what they are supposed to feel like. As I've grown up (now graduated), the bumps are the size of a small mandarin orange, but they are exactly the same on both sides, and when I pinch them, it isn't hard, per se, but feels like thick fibres. 

I am absolutely terrified of the doctors, and last time I went (for lower belly pain), they made me take a pregnancy test even after I told them I've never done it. After it came back negative, they told me that they don't know what is wrong, and so I left without learning anything. Now I don't trust them to actually help me, and Google is terrible for this type of question. (I live in a pretty rural area, and it's hard to find a good doctor)

imacatsrsly,1591796911,"Hey everyone. I posted a while ago about surgery coming up. I'm having difficulty deciding what to do. My surgical oncologist and plastic surgeon are both pushing for me to only have one breast done.

Here's the scoop... No genetic high risk. Stage 3 IDC on right side with one lymph node involved. Because of the multiple spread out lesions I will need to have a skin sparing mastectomy on the right side (will lose my nipple) with reconstruction. Nothing NEEDS to be done with the left side medically.

I am very concerned with symmetry of my breasts and am leaning towards having both done. Also I am afraid I will worry about developing cancer in the other breast, even though doctors have assured me that I'm not ""at an increased risk"" for that.

The plastic surgeon also said that they could do a small implant on the good side down the road but it wouldn't be a complete match and having an implant makes it harder to screen for cancer via mammogram. Soooo why not just get it all removed then?

Just fyi I don't care about losing the sensation of the nipple or breast. I know a lot of women experience some sexual dysfunction with that but it's something I have never cared about and will not miss. I'm more concerned with the appearance and symmetry of my breasts.

As I said I'm leaving towards just having a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction but I can't help but feel like I'm dumb for doing so.



So I'm looking to you for advice. Has anyone just opted to have both done and are happy with it? Has anyone only had one done and were happy with it? Has anyone regretted having both or one done?

I need to decide by the end of this week 😔",0

Greasy_Mandingo,1532266566,"From what I understand my mom (42) had a lump in her breast. It seems to be attached, painless, and hard. I've heard these are all bad precursors. She described it as oblong and kind of ""fingery""? (I think has fibrous tissue coming off it?) 

She has had the MRI, some other screenings, now she is waiting on the results of her Biopsy. I may be getting ahead of myself but I just feel helpless if I'm not accumulating more information. 

So my question is (I'll edit in more specifics as I find them out) are the characteristics of the lump pretty definitive that it's not a cyst or fibroadenoma? Does the fact that its attached or ""fingery"" mean it's more likely to have spread? Would there be other symptoms or signs if she had more advanced breast cancer?

themostacceptable,1597296391,"I've been on it for just 47 days. At 39 days I started experiencing some pain in my lower abdomen. I spent most of yesterday in the ER because it got severe enough for me to get convinced by a friend who recently had it to convince me it was possibly appendicitis. Ultrasounds showed that my ovaries are covered in cysts. Some have ruptured, some haven't. My left ovary is absolutely huge because of the cysts. It's supposed to be 3cm and they told me they're concerned for torsion at 5cm. Mine is 8cm. They initially thought it was my right ovary because it's just bouncing around in there and was crossed over the front of my uterus. They think the pain is because the hemorrhagic cysts on my left ovary are filling quickly and also I may have experienced torsion but that it untied itself. The ER gyn is certain they're caused by tamoxifen as I have no history of cysts and my scans when I was diagnosed last September/October were clear. The pain is awful. Not 10/10, but certainly very uncomfortable and Tylenol doesn't alleviate it. If I'm sitting down, it can go up to a 5/10. If I'm walking, it can quickly jump to a 7 or 8.

My mom recently had her mastectomy after being diagnosed with Stage 1 Breast Cancer (HER2). 

At first she was finally calm and taking everything one day at a time when her pathology came back negative for cancer. But because the size of the cancerous cell were a certain size, it was finally diagnosed to be Stage 2. The doctors are recommending for her to do chemo for prevention. She will be taking the following:

Pertuzumab
Trastuzumab
Carboplatin
Docetaxel 

Right now, her fears are coming up again. The Latinx community has a lot of misconceptions and fears about cancer because of lack of resources and education. She gets more afraid especially because when speaking with doctors there is a language barrier.

From talking to her, her worst fear is that cancer will come back. She started doing research about the chemo, and it makes her afraid that while reading things like “gives 5 years of chance of survival” come up.

Danceswithdragons20,1534694392,"I'm a 24(f). So back story: 4 years ago I changed birth control to see if it worked better for me  for the next month I had an extremely large left breast. It was red and so itchy and horribly painful. An ultrasound was done and I was told I had a few cyst and fibrocystic breast. More than likely triggered or made worse by the b.c. fast forward 3 years (last november) and my Bob is so uncomfortable and I can feel the lumps and some slight clear leaking. I visited a new gyno (I was new to the area) I explained my past and and she felt my breast and said it was cyst. I asked if something could be done about it (hello! I'm in pain. Could we drain it? Run test on it. I didn't specifically state this as I figured she would understand.) She looked at me and says ""well if you want your breast removed we can have it scheduled"". And that's when I said no I meant draining it. And basically she said there is no point as it's a fluid filled sac and might come back. 

Fast forward to January. I saw a new general practitioner. I told her what was going on. She felt around. Could feel the lumps. And sent me off for a mammogram and ultrasound. I was told that absolutely nothing was seen on the ultrasound and  nothing was seen on the mammogram. They did note that I have dense breast tissue in that breast but not in my other breast. The doc thought it was a tad odd that we could both feel lumps but nothing was gotten on the images. She said that its hormonal cysts and maybe where I was in my cycle made them go away/shrink. And I asked for a biopsy then and she said because we ""have no images of a lump that it couldn't be biopsied because they have to know what to look for"".

It's currently August. I'm freaking out. My breast is swollen and one lump hurts so bad that it is interfering with my day to day life. But now my back on my right hand side is hurting. It almost leaves me to think it's a kidney stone but it hurts in particular when I laugh, sneeze, or cough. I made the appointment last week for that but now my breast seems to be hurting and swollen.

Yortroy,1571752165,"About three weeks ago my 52 year old wife thought she could feel a lump on her left breast. She also felt like she could not breathe at night and her lungs felt as though she had smoked which she has not done in 27 years.  That night the breathing problem got so bad she thought she was having a heart attack so we went to the ER that found nothing in the heart or lungs (basic ER scan possibly for pneumonia only is my guess) 
We scheduled a mammogram right away, that was followed by a biopsy which showed the unfortunate news that arrived last week.
At this point what we know is that they think it is  1.1 cm, invasive lobular carcinoma, 90% estrogen, and 95% progesterone. HER 2 is not back yet and is Grade 2. Staging is not revealed yet but we have an appointment with the surgeon tomorrow and she may tell us hopefully only stage 1.
She has trouble breathing every night with the same symptoms and is terrified that there has been spreading to the lungs.  There are more tests and scans to be done but in the meantime the wait and anticipation is surreal.  She recently was prescribed diazepam and then Ativan to help sleep but it seems to only mask the problem. She has never used either of those or anything like that before but does seem to help.
The reality of her fear is breaking me. I know that there is that possibility of spread, but also try to remind her that it is still early and most likely not the case. Her primary told her that was a valid concern and she is right, but the honestly just intensified the worry.
We have not reached out to any family but our adult daughters and her sister. The only people who know are my supervisor and her supervisors. She is on leave and we are going to have some financial challenges with the loss of income but I do have plenty of sick time and my supervisor is very supportive of me taking the time to be with her for all appointments and treatment. We have insurance.
My challenge is that I want to listen to every word and concern in the best way I can, and support every tiny bit of everything she is going through.  She tends to worry about the worse and when the possibility of it being spread to her lungs comes up I have a very hard time keeping composure. I can’t let her see how upset I am and must stay strong for her. She can’t see me crying but I am truly freaked out and can’t bear to see how scared she is. 
If i could take the cancer away and put it in me I would do that in a heartbeat for 
my best friend and partner of 25 years.
Any helpful advise would be welcome.

CancerSurvivorship,1535626229,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

Beating-Gatsby,1578690495,"Hi, I’m Enette and I’m a 38 year old Saffa living in England. It’s not really me to do this as I’m more the private type but I wanted to share my story.

I come from a very remote part of South Africa called Brandvlei, a farming community and my family are sheep farmers. I’ve lived in the UK for 14 years. 

I now work in Finance in London and live with my English partner and two wonderful young girls. 

In December 2019 I was away on my families farm and noticed a lump in my right breast, turns out I have stage 2, grade 3 triple negative breast cancer that has spread to one lymph node. Following the heart breaking news on the 23rd of December we decided to have a great Christmas and tackle this head on in 2020! We kept it quiet from our loved ones, with hindsight I don’t think I’ll ever know if that was the right thing to do...

Anyone that’s been through this will know how hard it is to tell family and children, especially when your parents and siblings are in different countries. This was no different and one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. To lift spirits and start the fight against Gatsby my partner Mark moved a trip to NYC forward and we went off to have an incredible 4 days in a cold but fun packed City on the 2nd of January 2020. I hope one day I will look back on that and truly realize that was when I decided to beat it. 

I now have 16 chemo sessions to do, followed by a possible operation and then radiotherapy. Day one was the 9th of January 2020 and it’s been a slightly outer body experience so far. What I mean by this is, well,  it’s been too easy... I feel naive as I know there are darker days ahead. 

For today though, I’ll take the good days and cross the bridge on the dark days. 

Gatsby by the way is a name we gave CANCER. Read it and say it out loud, cancer. Makes you feel slightly cold and most people look at the floor in this almost child like awkwardness... cancer .. they assume you’re dying or dead. Well, I choose life, I choose to fight, I chose my favorite decade from the Twentieth Century, the 20’s. If I’d live in a decade that’s one I’d have loved to have experienced. 

As we found out I had cancer, we were ending a year, a decade and starting the 20’s. Gatsby seems a fitting name.

Follow me to hear about my fight against Gatsby and share stories, the good ones and not so good ones. I’d love to hear your story too.

Thank you for reading.

random1832,1549517806,"hi everyone, i’ve been worried about a lump in both my breasts that i noticed around 7 years ago (i’m now 17). 
i got it checked by a doctor then and he told me my breasts were just growing. i came back several months ago because it didn’t seem to get better over the years and he told me the same thing. 
my breasts do have an odd shape but it doesn’t look “unhealthy”, i’ve seen women with breasts the same shape. what worry me are the lumps, their texture and how big they are (they’re in a “spaceship” shape, taking up almost my whole breast and i can “move it around” with my fingers and actually pinch it and sort of hold it). 
it’s painful sometimes.

I don't mean it in a negative way, just that the only thing people see when they look at me is ""oh, she has cancer"". I have chemo-induced hair loss and I've opted not to have a wig. I am comfortable with my choice, but I just feel branded when I go outside. Granted, I am not leaving my house much with the pandemic, but when I go for walks or drive around people stare. One time on my walk someone asked if they should be praying for me. I just miss my normal life. I'm 26 years old. I want to enjoy my youth. Instead I have to endure this, with a pandemic on top of it all. When I look in the mirror I don't see someone I recognize. I miss brushing my hair, getting my eyebrows threaded, putting on mascara, feeling pretty. I feel like I'm forever marked as the girl who got breast cancer at a young age. I don't want it to define my life, but I'm sure it will.

veedey,1598646057,"I'm a 25 year old male. One year ago a red bump, the same as a small bug bite, showed up on the left side of my chest. Persistent and not going away. Strange. Few months later I had a biopsy and it showed benign inflammation, but my dermatologist has no idea what it is. It did not go away on its own, so we tried topical steroids which did nothing, and then a steroid injection which somewhat flattened the bump, but it's still there. It's not growing above or below the skin. It's just...there. It slightly hurts every once in a while, sometimes because I poke the s\*\*\* out of it making sure it's not growing. My doctor wants to wait a few more months to see how it progresses, and then try injecting it again with a steroid. After that, another biopsy if needed. 

Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Are benign inconclusive bumps like this at all common? And is there a chance that something like this could become malignant over time? The internet is the worst place to look for answers. The only piece of information I've been able to find about chest bumps that ""resemble bug bites"" is inflammatory breast cancer, which I know is already super rare in women, and even more so in men.

losingmymind82,1594573916,"So, I am recently diagnosed with DCIS at 36 years old.  I am in the process of waiting for genetic testing. My mother has had DCIS twice now, once in each breast. She has also had a carcinoma. My doctors are pushing me to do the lumpectomy and radiation now, which I’m hesitant to do. I don’t want to potentially set myself up for 2 surgeries should the genetic testing indicate a mastectomy would be best. Also, I know of 2 women who did the lumpectomy and radiation. They both had a recurrence in the same breast years later, and had to get a mastectomy. Both of these women aren’t able to have reconstruction done due to damage to their skin from the previous radiation. Is this a more common thing or rare? If I was to ever have a recurrence I would absolutely want reconstruction, and this is really holding me back from doing the lumpectomy/radiation. My current oncologist just kind of acknowledged that can happen, and started talking about the lumpectomy again. I have an appointment set for the 20th for a second opinion at one of the best cancer centers in my area.

Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional, nor a chemist. I'm just another BC fighter who happens to have the hobby of researching random stuff online.  If it's a topic that's important for me or my family, that's where I dive so deep I need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find my way back. I found this during one of those deep dives.

Wound care is important, but we also want it to heal fast and hopefully minimize scaring. I think I found something that might help y'all with that. It did me good. 

I stumbled across this last year before my DMX.  I had always though that essential oils for actual medical purposes was a load of crap (still think most are).  Note this is not some pseudo-science crap, this is straight from National Institute of Health (USA), a study THEY did.   


Long story short, they took a bunch of rats and made identical incisions in each. 'Control' group was those that received standard wound care. The 2nd group received no care. The 3rd group had pure lavender oil used on the wound.  If you want to dive into the study yourself (find an online medical dictionary if you're not a professional) the link is at the top of this post.

  


[Easy to see which ones healed the quickest.](https://preview.redd.it/gz02ugd5vke51.jpg?width=567&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203a2ca0ea7b2b2793a12685bda98379c5019213)

I mentioned this to my CNP and Surgeon and asked if they had heard of it. (didn't have a smart phone to dig it up at the time). When the surgeon started in on a 'Dr Google' joke I interrupted him and said 'It's on the NIH site you can find it yourself'. (this was last year, before he learned not to crack that joke at me). Now my hospitals have an app where I can send links like this directly to my CNP and/or surgeon.   


I figured if it did so good for the rats with a tiny cut, it might do me a bit of good (if nothing else help me relax, eh?). I use coconut oil as a moisturizer after showers because the skin soaks it up like a sponge (great for so many uses besides cooking). Along with the standard wound care I started using a mixture of 1/4 cup coconut oil with 5-6 drops of lavender oil (stir well) I got from our local pharmacy; Not food grade lavender oil, just plain old essential oil (about $8 for a tiny bottle here). I use a small glass jar like what pre-diced garlic comes in. Just scooped enough to cover my finger tips, smeared exclusively on the DMX incisions at first, shower every day and damn I was getting results! Especially after the skin glue came off! Even the surgeon was surprised at the 2 week checkup. 6 wks checkup he was shocked at how nice and clean the area looked and how well it healed. He actually looked it up then. 'Dr Google' my ass :P   


Note that it didn't help much with the itchy as the wound heals, for that I use an antibiotic ointment with numbing. I'm trying to figure out how I can mix the lavender oil with numbing antibiotic ointment, not sure of what ratio to use, maybe a drop or two per teaspoon? Waiting to find a small enough glass jar to try it. (I'll update if I can pull it off and let y'all know those results, IMO it's an experiment worth trying.)  


My arms always have some kind of scratches on them. We have 3 cats (none of which like me too much, except when I'm feeding them) and 2 dogs who seriously need nails clipped and I'm too paranoid to do it. While the cats scratch maliciously the dogs do it on accident, especially my pup Canis, he gets a little excited while we're playing lol.  When using the coconut/lavender mix on my arms and the scratches heal in a few days instead of a week or more. Doesn't stop more scratches from coming lol, but at least my arms don't look as bad as they used to.  Any extra on my hands I put on my face and throat... IDK if it helps with wrinkles lol but it sure feels nice and smells so good! Sometimes after a bath I'll splurge and use that for all over moisturizer instead of the regular plain coconut oil, esp if I'm showering before bedtime. I've also noticed over the past year using that my skin's texture is changing for the better and older scars are fading slightly. I've even gotten my guys to daub a little on cuts and they heal a bit faster, long as I can get them to do it every day for 3 or 4 days. My younger sister gets keloid scars even from a tiny scratch. She promised she would try it next time to see if it helps with healing, maybe it'll minimize the bump. (If y'all want I'll update and let you know how it worked for her).   


I've seen some beautiful tattoo work used to cover DMX scars and want to go that route. My oldest son does tattooing, but won't touch scars because they can be tough (understandable, too bad I wanted him to do the work). Most tattoo artists that do want you to wait at least 12-18 mo post op. 8 mo after DMX I asked him to check and he said it was almost ready. at 10 mo post op he said he thought it would handle it.  I should have had him at least do the outline work before this last surgery. Now I've got to wait longer :(   


Note that coconut oil is a soft solid at room temp (25°C/75°F) and melts at body temp (37°C/97°F) so once you scoop it out of the jar be quick about putting it on. I don't store it in the bathroom where it always gets hot and steamy (fridge it will get really hard) And I always use the small glass jars to mix/store it in, not plastic or tupperware.  I don't just use it after bath, i'll use it anytime I think about it, at least once a day. Don't wipe it off like you would using just the plain oil. Leave it on (unless you've got sticky bandages to put on, then wipe those areas. but try your best to leave it directly on the incision). Oh and keep it away from dogs. They love to lick coconut oil as much as peanut butter, but I've read that lavender can be toxic to dogs. Don't think it bothers cats, I didn't look tbh.  


Hope this helps someone out as much as it helped me. We're all fighting this same war in our own way and we need every weapon in our arsenal we can scrounge up.",1

emmanoir,1589316929,"24/f - So I’m honestly just really confused at this point. I went to an immediate care for a lump I found at the 3 o’clock position on my left breast. It’s almost like sore, but not painful. The doctor at the immediate care felt the lump, and sent me for an ultrasound at the breast health center. Seemed like it was serious based on her demeanor. I went for the ultrasound the next day (today). The tech felt the lump and even described it as “a large one, with a little one on top of it.” Took some pictures, and left for the radiologist. They both come back in, the radiologist does a physical exam and looks around with the u/s. Comments on how skinny I am, and says she sees NOTHING. Not one thing. Says the pain is something about weight loss, my chest wall, and muscles. Refuses to give me a mammogram (I asked). Signs me off as BI-RADS 1 or 2 and sends me on my way. Fast forward to two hours later - the original doctor who sent me for the u/s calls, and says she doesn’t agree with the results. That she knows what she felt and it makes no sense for there to just be nothing. She is referring me to a breast surgeon tomorrow morning for hopefully an MRI.
