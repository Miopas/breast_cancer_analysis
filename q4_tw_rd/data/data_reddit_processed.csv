incredally07,1602699352,"I just need to complain a little.  I got my last tissue expander fill yesterday - reconstruction will be during the last week of November!  But holy hell did this last fill hurt.  I wanted to rip them out.  It’s been a whole day now and my chest and back are still sore.  It’s hard to get comfortable.  The muscle relaxers and pain meds didn’t help much but at least helped me get a little sleep.  I’m trying to do some gentle stretching and use my back massager for relief today.  I’m so so so happy that was my last fill.  It sure let me know it too.  

I can power through it.  I know it’s gotten better in a few days I’ll forget all about the pain.  Thanks for listening."
cookiebatter123,1602637885,My mum (50) has just been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. The doctors are saying chemo for the next 6 months and possible surgery. Does anyone have any info on what to expect? Or what this all means? All articles I read just leave me confused and nervous.
wonkishgardener,1602630055,"3 days of radiation left (woo hoo!) and suddenly, like almost overnight, I have a crazy itchy rash. Dr recommends Cortisol or something similar. I've been using aloe 3x/day. Any good home remedies until I get the cream (or maybe better than??)?"
HonorableMention111,1602628724,"I’ve been on chemo since the beginning of June and have my final dose tomorrow. Thought that when I finally got to this point that I would be pretty happy...but not even an ounce of excitement. No idea why. Maybe because now I have to think about surgery in a month and there are still so many unknowns (stage, radiation, reconstruction).  I don’t know. Maybe it’s the hormone therapy. Maybe I’m just moody. I’ve been rolling my eyes at the celebration texts I’ve been getting today. Sigh. This battle..."
Handy_Raccoon323,1602627408,"Please excuse the formatting I'm on shitty mobile. 

We (myself, hubby, doctor) don't know if I have cancer or not, but I had a punch biopsy performed on my right breast this morning. The doctor is checking for inflammatory breast cancer/any other breast diseases or disorders, even if benign. 

I'm 23 so this is a great way to spend my party years. But pity party over. (Hah.) Story time.

I came home after having the biopsy done on the part of my breast that is most affected by gravity. (H-cups. These babies are heavy lemme tell you guys and gals something.) I couldn't stand wearing a bra, but the alternative, gravity, hurt just as much.

 So my husband kindly drove home on his lunch break to meet me the moment I got home. He walked the dog for me, then made me a t-shirt sling that wraps around my shoulder and will hold my breast up for the next few weeks to heal.

Hope this didn't seem too lighthearted about this whole mess. It sucks. But if I don't laugh I'll cry, and I'll choose laughter every time.

Let me know how you felt waiting for a diagnosis. Any tips on healing this bad boy? Thanks, everyone, I wish you all good health."
GurCake,1602624971,"Hi everyone just need to vent. Reconstruction surgery, which was delayed because of COVID, was due to happen this week. Separately I was seeing a gynae as, while there was no history of breast cancer in my family, I did have an aunt with ovarian cancer. As a precaution and to check out how things were in that region the gynae sent me for a pelvic ultrasound. It was just supposed to a baseline check as I’m 40 but low and behold it found two ovarian cysts, one simple, one complex. 

Went to see her today to talk about this, not thinking too much about it, as I know cysts aren’t that uncommon and can even be a side effect of tamoxifen which I’ve been taking for a few months. Well boy was I in for a surprise. I’ve to go back in tomorrow for blood tests (ca125/tumor markers which can help detect ovarian cancer) and even if they are ok she’s still recommending removal of the ovary due to the size of the complex cyst (6cm) and so it can be analyzed properly. She wants to do this in a couple of weeks so no reconstruction for me until this gets figured out. 

I can’t believe this is happening, I know others have it harder but I feel like I can’t move on at all. Just when I was trying to focus on the positives of a reconstruction and starting to feel a bit better about myself this happens. Not to mention the worry that this is going to be something sinister. I mean how does someone even get two types of cancer in under a year??? While actually having chemo for one of them! I’d have to be the unluckiest fecker on the planet wouldn’t I? 

Don’t think there will be much sleep for me tonight."
Yeswowlikejustwow,1602612220,"Hello all! 👋🏻 I am a designer working on an app that supports breast cancer patients one year after their mastectomy. In this app we would like the users to have the ability to post what they’re going through and have other users react with custom reactions. These reactions are: “Love” “Support” “Helpful” and “Strength.” For each of these reactions I need to portray them as an icon. HOWEVER.... we just got some feedback that it is NOT OK to use an 💪 arm for our icon that represents “Strength.” My other design colleagues and I want to know what this subreddit thinks. 👀 Is it insensitive, or does it make you feel uncomfortable to have strength portrayed as an 💪 arm? Is there a preference to use a shield to represent “strength”? OR how would you represent “sending someone strength” in an icon? 😅 thank you in advance! We really appreciate your feedback."
LlamaLlamaNightyNite,1602603124,"Hey ladies, day 4 after second round of TCHP over here... so things are pretty interesting. Definitely would give this a 1 star yelp review. This time around it’s hit me psychologically, and I’ve been a little dark. Because of this I am forcing myself to find the funny things about this most exclusive club we all never asked to join but seem to be paying dues anyways. 

For me, is the endless runny nose. I am a walking waterfall. At least it’s this end, am I right?

Also, I haven’t had to shave anywhere in over a week. Silky smooth. Lol.

My oncologist has switched me to Kadcyla which is a type of chemo/ immunotherapy treatment I receive infusions of for another 6 months.

anonymouzzz__,1602556095,Hey everyone I’m 22 f and recently my left armpit started hurting. It’s a pain that comes and goes especially if I have my arm a certain way. I’ve checked to see if it’s a swollen lymph node but I don’t feel any lump or anything. It hurts if I press on to it tho. I know I’m going to make an appt with my gp.

lost-vulpecula,1602553171,"Emotions in full swing, today is a mentally rough day.

Day 11 post cycle 2 of TCHP and I'm still waiting to feel better, still hoping I can get a little bit of good time with my son before they hit me again with this nightmare combo.

My heart has been acting weird, and my blood pressure is through the roof - I'm on medicine for it but need to up the dose. I'm still losing an ungodly amount of weight, still have the constant metal taste in my mouth.. almost all my hair is gone now, what is left makes me look like the crypt keeper..

I keep asking myself how I'm suppose to keep doing this, knowing that I have to anyways, keep trying to tell myself it'll be alright and I'll be okay, but it doesn't feel like it right now, it feels like even as I get further from the infusion date, I'm not improving, I'm just staying sick..

I know that I will do this, that I have to, that I've still got 4 cycles to go through, but right now it feels like I can't do it, I don't have the strength..I'm sorry if this is all depressing, it's just a rough day, I suppose."
vodkachutney08,1602546810,"Hi all, a small background before I get to my question. My mum age 45 was diagnosed with stage 2 triple negative breast cancer and finished her treatment for it in Sep'19. Yesterday, we found out that she has new lesions in her lungs and brain and we will be starting with radiation therapy for the brain. 

Her oncologist mentioned that since its TNBC, there is nothing one can really do to predict or keep this in check and all one can do is monitor and keep treating if something has been found. 

My question: Is there anything at all that can be done, any new research or treatment options that we can look into other than the usual radiation+chemo. (I know there is not really much one can do but to fight this but well here's hoping...) Thanks in advance."

But today got the call that my right breast has malignant cells, Stage 0 ductal cell in situ in multiple locations, grade 3 out of 3.  I tried to ask what the grade 3 meant over the phone, but didn't get much of an answer except that is was related to degree of abnormality.  Does anyone have more information regarding what grade 3 means for prognosis, treatment, whatever?

I’m getting ready to start chemo and pretty sure we are done having kids due to my age (38) and health issues but Zoladex was mentioned as an option for suppressing the ovaries. Is it worth it? What side effects did you have? I’m prone to hormonal acne... does it make that worse?
jpmcouto,1602451753,"Some info: early 50s, completely healthy (and I mean almost athlete healthy) outside of this. 

I don't want to put too much detail but from what I read here she did something extremely common: hide it from almost everyone around her, especially people who could only worry from afar. 

Surgery went fine, no signs of spreading. Post surgery comes along and oncologist tells her she will only need 4 cycles of chemo and should be completely fine before news year eve and could visit her relatives. The next day she is on the road going back home and the doctor calls saying her treatment was revised and she will be doing 16 cycles within 5 months.

All the worries of hair loss and worrying people around her have come back, and she is having pretty negative thoughts about refusing treatment and saying that she was healthy all her life for nothing.

How can we help, besides obviously recommending psychological counseling?"
kgscherer,1602445564,"Very recently my close friend has been diagnosed with breast cancer which has spread to her lymph nodes. She is about to start 20 rounds of chemo which will be followed by radiation. She has four children, the youngest of whom is 8 and extremely close with my 8 yr old son. They live very nearby and have been seeing  each other once a week or so during the pandemic. She is in health care and is tested regularly. I just had a negative test and our family has using masks, staying home and being pretty cautious during this time. 

We visit a country club a few times a week so the kids can swim in the pool. We're masked out of the pool and do not go indoors. Her son accompanies us often and I'd be lying if I said the kids social distance when they swim and play with each other and other kids who are at the pool. (please don't judge - my children are prone to anxiety and depression and it was starting to get critical - we joined the club 1.5 months ago so they could have this interaction, knowing it was a calculated risk)

My friend is extremely concerned about her son's mental health and wants him to continue to interact with my son. The pool will close in a few weeks but I will likely take them outdoors to play in a park and there will be other kids around. Would like to hear thoughts on making sure that my son and I are testing weekly and have a negative result the day before we interact with her son. Thank you in advance."
hermeowniegranger,1602414371,"Hi all, 
I’m 26, brca 1 positive and had a breast MRI last week. It came back suspicious with two spots in my right breast and I’m scheduled for an ultrasound with the possibility of a biopsy for next week. From my limited (and probably unwise) googling I’m struggling to find out how likely it is that I’ll end up getting a biopsy from their ultrasound findings? I know an answer to this question won’t change the likelihood of needing a biopsy but I’m feeling like I’m scrambling without enough information. 
Thank you all!"
jepsd19,1602387822,"Hi, sorry if this isn’t the place for this, but I had fibroadenoma surgery in June and there’s still some scarring I’m concerned about. 

The actual incision scar itself is barely noticeably, but there’s two little bumps on the outside of my breast. I guess the best way to describe it is that they feel like hard tissue, they’re pink and raised and noticeable to me and I want them to go away but I’m not even sure what they are? Stitches from the procedure? 

Has anyone had anything like this and does it go away? I just wasn’t told I would have something like this and I don’t know if my boob is supposed to look like this forever."
lost-vulpecula,1602382408,"Hello again, everyone, finally starting to feel better after cycle two of  TCHP chemo and now I've got questions regarding some things.

First, what does it mean when people say chemotherapy side effects are cumulative? Are things going to get worse with each one? Or is it on a case-by-case kind of thing?

Second, I've suddenly developed indigestion, which I've never in my life experienced and makes it impossible to eat normally - is this a side effect of the chemos or something I should be looking into elsewhere (will be asking about it regardless, but curious all the same)

Third, this chemo mouth...what can I do about it? Everything is slimy, tastes metallic, or feels like licking a battery! Does it go away farther from the infusion or does it just stay eventually?

Fourth, are aggressive mood swings normal? No one mentioned anything about any kind of emotional affects, so I'm not sure what can be expected and what is out of the ordinary!

And finally, what can I do about my skin? The hair is already a loss, and to some degree I've accepted that, but my skin is freaking out. It's behaving like I've had a sunburn or something, I'm really not sure how to explain it other than dry, peeling, and angry.

Thank you for any answers, it's comforting to know that I can ask here for first hand experiences"

First time I’ve felt beautiful in months. However, when I removed them and took off the liner (I used magnetic lashes), I pulled off a bunch of my natural lashes too. 

I loved the look of the false lashes, but I don’t want to cause additional damage to my natural lashes. Does anyone have any tips? I’m thinking about eyelash extensions but I worry about the damage with that too.

Hybridphenome,1602339992,"Hi everyone!  Just wondering if anyone is/has experienced this issue, 
Just at the end of my 6th cycle of taxo/carbo I started having discomfort in my hips and knees. 
When I change position; sitting to standing and vice versa it’s so so sore and I have to hobble for a bit to get through it. It varies day by day in severity.
My oncologist said it’s just one of those things where you just be patient post treatment as it goes away. 
I am doing PT right now and I stretch twice a day for an hour but it only helps momentarily.
I am in remission (heck yeah!!!) and 3 most post chemo (7weeks post mastectomy and expander placement). 
Kinda wondering if there is anything else fair to consider to help or help me be patient.

Christinarose88,1602283688,"To sum up what happened to me, about 6 months ago I went in to get an ultrasound of a mass I had in my breast for a few years. I am 20, and I had this mass since I was about 16. For my yearly checkup at my pediatrician, they would always tell me to not worry about it and it was probably a cyst. Fast forward to when I go in to my OBGYN in around february, they are much more concerned and tell me to get an appt. with the imaging center asap.  After the ultrasound we found a 4.5 cm sclerosing mass that looked really nasty on the ultrasound, with a lot of blood flow. (They rated it BI-RADS 4b). Then they got me in for a emergency biopsy within the week. Before the biopsy, they also sent me to a cancer institute and I am also a patient there with a great oncologist (even though I hadn't been diagnosed with cancer). After the core needle biopsy I was told it was a massive sclerosing intraductal papilloma with some atypical features. They recommended I get it removed immediately. So, fast forward to today, I had my 6 month post op (from lumpectomy) with my oncologist. She said she talked to the radiologist and they agreed I should have a check up ultrasound. So now, only 6 months after the removal of the massive papilloma, I have 3 new cysts, (1 is complex) and a new mass about 1cm. They told me to wait 6 months for another ultrasound to see where everything is at. But, I don't know if i feel comfortable with that? I talked to the radiologist and oncologist who both said thats standard protocol. (which i know it is). But, in my case, im only 20 and already had a very odd tumor and now these 4 abnormalities grew in less than 6 months from surgery... The new mass was rated BI-RADS 3.. which i know standard protocol is to re image in 6 months. Should I just wait? Should I push for a biopsy sooner? I'm just nervous and unsure what to do :("

oqkitty,1602235857,"My mom went in for a yearly mammography in June 2019, found out she has a tumor and went in for treatment. She hasn't told me or my sister during all this time (we are the only family she has + distant siblings in different countries), I found out in December when I saw her naked and saw scars from her surgery. She was denying even then...

Both me and my sister were really angry at her - and we still are. I wanted to add this because I am feeling she is not telling me the whole truth and my trust in her is a bit shaken. And since I basically started supporting her at the end of her treatment I really have no clue about her diagnosis. She keeps saying ""it's not even proper cancer"", I believe the tumor is under 3cm, however in the report they say there was no lymphovascular invasion, yet they took out a few lymph nodes after they had reactive hyperplasia. Does that mean it has spread to her lymph nodes? 

And for her treatment, she had 6 chemotherapy treatments, lumpectomy with lymph node removal, a few months of radiotherapy and now started 5 years of hormone therapy (Double positive). 

I feel like she is downplaying seriousness of her disease and I am incredibly upset at her. Both me and my sister are adults, 24 &amp; 27, but she is treating us like children."

Oncologist wanted to try again, but I declined never wanting to go through that again (4 nurses, 2 oncologists &amp; an ECG later). They have me scheduled now for Docetaxel which is a part of the same group of drugs as Taxol - so still a possibility of having a reaction to that as well.

fadedpie,1602135513,"Hi, my grandmother has stage 4 breast cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and she managed to have mastectomy done while it was on stage 3c. Doctor said the breast cancer might re occur and so she gave us hormone therapy, in the form of letrozole. She said that due to her old age, it is recommended that we skip chemotherapy and so we did. I'm pretty sure that was a very bad decision now, at this point. Just 6 months after surgery, we saw a lump at the surgery site. Doctor confirmed it to be a breast cancer recurrence. Her medication was changed to Tamoxifen but it wasn't really effective as her lump kept growing. Her treatment was then changed to radiotherapy alongside injections of fulvestrant. Soon after, we saw some small lumps on her stomach area. The biopsy confirmed it to be cancer but the profile has changed and it is now only 2% hormone receptive. The oncologist therefore said that her only possible treatment at this point is chemotherapy and so we discussed about it. I myself though that we should at least try out the chemo and perhaps immunotherapy as well. The oncologist on the otherhand will not allow chemotherapy to be done on my grandmother saying she is too old and it might worsen her dementia. My grandmother also has diabetes. I'm going to see another doctor for a second opinion but is it really best to not even attempt chemotherapy on my grandmother?  I'm not very sure and any advice will really help. Without chemotherapy she really isn't really receiving any form of treatment due to the new tumors not being hormone receptive, I think. Any help and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

TMI issue and quite embarrassing for me, but I don't know where else to turn. I am new here to the subreddit and thought I would post my issue and see if anyone else has had the same problems with hormone therapy. I am 37 and was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago at 35. I went through chemo, surgery, and radiation. I started hormone therapy late last year (Tamoxifen). Ever since then, I have been getting recurrent anal fissures that will not heal (or will heal, but then return). Mind you, I do NOT have major digestive issues (I'm very regular and rarely ever get constipated; I almost always have soft stools). My diet is very healthy. I have seen multiple colon and rectal surgeons about the problem, been checked out numerous times for other problems like digestive issues or diseases (all negative), taken every ointment under the sun, and eventually had surgery to correct the muscle tension problem they were causing in June of this year, which did not help even though the surgery is 98% effective. When my surgeon examined me under anesthesia, he said the skin in the anal canal was very dried out and thin and there were many small cracks in it. He said it was like looking into the anus of ""a 90-year-old woman."" : ( I'm only 37.

I cannot help but think this is related to either the Tamoxifen I started taking and/or the Lupron shots I was getting (but have since stopped due to this… it has only been a month since I've been off the shots, so my body isn't back to normal yet and I got the 3-month shot the last time so it will probably be in my system longer). My colon and rectal surgeon said estrogen is vital for skin health and healing and encouraged me to stop the Lupron so I can heal (apparently this is why they don't start hormone therapy until AFTER surgery and radiation, so the body can heal quickly), even if temporarily. My oncologist, however, refuses to see any correlation between the fissures and the hormone therapy. She does not take my horrible side effect seriously.

I had fissures throughout chemo (due to horrible diarrhea from the meds, which was HELL), but they all healed very quickly after I finished and I was pain-free and blood-free for months. A colon and rectal surgeon even said my skin was very healthy and recovered then after he checked the area for healing. I recovered completely and was doing so well all through last year until I started the Tamoxifen and noticed I'd get fissures, then heal, then they'd just come back no matter how perfect my stools are. I cannot help but see a connection. Then I started Lupron and got even worse, just tearing over and over again. One fissure would heal, but then would re-open, or I'd form new ones, no matter how soft my stool was.

I simply cannot live like this anymore and am strongly considering stopping the Tamoxifen if getting rid of the Lupron does nothing. The pain I go through almost every day is unbearable and many times I have thought about suicide (I am currently seeing a therapist for this and taking antidepressants). I know there is a huge risk in stopping the meds, but I simply cannot enjoy my life like this. Quality of life is very important to me and I have none right now. I can't see how I can suffer like this for 5-10 years.  I just cannot see it. I have been in hell for the past year despite doing everything right to fix the problem and seeing multiple specialists. Of course I don't want the cancer to come back, but this is not living for me.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had a similar experience with these drugs. I'm currently waiting on more specialist appointments (another colon and rectal surgeon and a dermatologist, as well as a gastroenterologist) while I wait possibly months for the Lupron to leave my system. My oncologist pretty much gave up on me since I decided to stop the Lupron she was so adamant that I take. I was also diagnosed with mild osteoporosis in my hip, which further complicates things and I know Lupron and many of these drugs can aggravate that. I am going to look for another oncologist. Mine has dropped the ball on many things (did not even order a bone scan early enough, which is what I read most oncologists should do BEFORE starting Lupron) and won't give me the answers I need to make good decisions (like my overall risk of recurrence after stopping these meds). She just will not be an advocate to me and refuses to take my pain seriously, instead telling me to just see a therapist (which I AM, but that obviously isn't going to solve my problem!).

Sorry for the long post and the TMI, but I wanted to make sure I covered things so others could understand that I've exhausted a lot of my options. Thank you so much for reading and take care everyone. Cancer is truly a bitch. I am just looking for answers anywhere I can since I cannot seem to find many others with my problem. It seems vaginal atrophy can be common with these drugs (which I don't think I have or at least I'm not aware of it), but this seems to be rare.

TLDR: I have been having recurrent anal fissures since starting hormone therapy (Tamoxifen and Lupron) that have been getting worse and surgery didn't help due to thinning, dried out skin in the area. I don't want to live like this anymore on these drugs if they are the culprit and my oncologist doesn't give a rat's a\*s about quality of life and refuses to see any correlation. Looking if anyone has had similar experiences.

Thank you for listening and take care everyone."
mudblo0d,1602091983,"Hi all. I’m new. 28F. Breastfeeding my two month old. I have a toddler son as well. 

About two weeks ago I discovered a lump in my left breast and assumed a clogged duct. It’s been 2 weeks though and it hasn’t gone away. My first thought was clogged milk duct because duh, I’m nursing! But it doesn’t hurt and doesn’t have any of the characteristics of a clogged duct or mastitis. It’s firm, round/oval shaped. I can’t tell if it’s movable or if it has rough edges. 

It’s deep in the breast and about 1cm? Maybe 2? It’s at about 11 o clock and an inch up from the nipple. I have no other symptoms. My boobs are rather small (small B cups) and Ive checked multiple times and didn’t notice any other lumps. But this one is freaking me out. 

I have an appointment to be evaluated on Friday. 

Any advice or words of wisdom? I’m terrified :( 

Thank you ❤️"

thankyouforeveything,1602044716,"First off (25) female with a small toddler and a husband that works hard and for long hours. 
I’m very overwhelmed and having a bit of a cancer scare and my little one doesn’t understand and I’d like him to not of course. First off about 5 weeks ago I had a sharp pain and redness on my breast, with a large lump that filled my whole hand. It hurt badly and I went to hospital twice being told it was fibrosistic breast changes. 
Since then I’ve went to my obgyn 
She thinks it’s fibroendonomas, was sent out for biopsy by this point it was 20cm in size and had tripped over the past few weeks. 
My ob ordered and ultrasound 
The ultrasound confirmed it was tumor and not a cyst on the ultrasound it was jagged edges and my lymp nodes were swollen 
She’s now ordering a biopsy, she told me it wasn’t an infection but now it’s either an infection or cancer and I spoke to many medical professionals that say it does not look infected including her. I think she is trying not to scare me but obviously she’s very worried. God I can’t handle the stress I’m under and pretending I’m okay is killing me"
pizzaismypassion,1602033073,"Hi Everyone,

This is my first time posting in this sub, but I guess I just need someone to talk to who understands what I am going through. My mother (52) was diagnosed with T2N1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer in July of 2018. The tumour was ER and PR + but HER2 negative. Since then she has had dose dense chemo (AC-T, four treatments of each), a lumpectomy and radiation. She is currently taking tamoxifen. Everything went well.

I am concerned because recently she has complained of many of the same symptoms returning that she had at the time of her initial diagnosis such as, weight gain, fatigue, increase in breast size and shortness of breath. Although these symptoms did not appear all together and have been progressing over time I am still concerned.  She had her last mammogram in March of this year, it came back fine. But I cannot shake the fear of a reoccurrence. She tells me I am overreacting and the symptoms are side effects of all the treatments and tamoxifen, but I think she is being too cavalier. Since all of you ladies have looked this beast in the eyes please tell me what you think?  

TLDR: I am scared my mother's T2N1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer is back.

Thank you in advance to all who reply and hugs to all who are on the road to recovery :)"
metastatic_mindy,1601980341,"3 years. 

3 years with cancer. 

3 years of non stop appointments.

3 years of treatment. 

3 years of my life doing all I can to keep the monster at bay. 

3 years can feel like a lifetime and also like a blink of an eye. 

So much has changed and yet so much remains the same. 

I can't say that the last 3 years have been all bad but I can't say they haven't been terrible either. Finding a balance, learning to accept the unchangeable, carving out a new normal and settling into that new normal and realizing that despite my illness there can be joy and color and light, it just takes time. 

This is the kind of milestone no one ever wants to have as a part of their life and yet here it is a part of my life. A dark cloud that is just waiting to snatch me up and whisk me away without a second thought. 

3 years and I am still alive. Fuck you cancer. I know you are waiting for me but I have shit to do and people to love so you are just going to have to wait."
babie_0509,1601978687,"I (25F) have been really stressed out lately and I can’t stop checking left breast, found a lump 3 years ago and even consulted 3 doctors and they all told me that my lump isn’t serious. Last month, around sept 21-24 I had my period and a week after, my breast still hurts. Sometimes burning sensation that travels to my arm. I am really scared, I also noticed a line on my areola and one doctor said she couldn’t tell if it was dimpling because it could be due to my weight gain or weight loss. Anyone here who has a dimpling in the breast but turned out to be not cancer? 

I will be having my ultrasound tomorrow. Please i’m really scared. And because this has been on my mind for a while now I am experiencing body pains and I can’t focus anymore. Please include me in your prayers. Please please. 😭 :(

Too large for a lumpectomy, so in a two weeks I am having a mastectomy and reconstruction. I am nervous about both the surgery and post-op recovery. 

I’d appreciate hearing from anyone with experience with this and any suggestions of things I could be doing to ready my house for recovery. 

I have a work-from-home office job and am planning on taking two weeks off and then try a few hours a day on the computer and checking in with my team via phone or zoom. Does that sound reasonable? Or am I pushing it?

hushhushquiet,1601905565,"Hello. I was diagnosed at 40 with stage 2 ductal carcinoma early 2018, and was treated with a lumpectomy, chemo, and rads. At the time things were pretty bad, I had to look after my mother who was dementing and my teenaged daughter who was struggling with suicidal ideation; I was single and didn't have much support.

I had a variety of complications during treatment (hypersensitivity to chemo, overdose of chemo, neutropenia, acute radiation burns) which didn't help things. The long term treatment (zoladex and exemestane) gives me musculoskeletal pain severe enough to have to leave my nursing career.

2 years post treatment I'm still out of work and in pain. Life seems very bleak and it's hard to see any sort of future, with 10 years of treatment on the cards. I often wish I hadn't survived, which I know is a terrible thing to say but I can't help feeling that way nonetheless.

Dyalad,1601816206,"Pink October. Every year since I’ve had cancer, October is always a mixed bag of feelings. There is a lot of stuff out there to highlight the importance of prevention, raising money for the causes, and all. But also a lot of glamorizing. Pictures of well-shaped, perfect boobs with pink ribbon pasties or stock pictures of women that have never had cancer with cancer related props.

But there’s also the resentment. The feeling of anger that people afflicted by other types of cancer are being forgotten, not listened to, because their cancer is not as prevalent or understood. My heart bleeds for them. 

There’s also the ladies like me which the word cure has no meaning anymore. The ones with metastatic cancer. People running for a cure. Can’t they also run for wellness, comfort for the ones who can’t make it?

It’s totally a rant post, and sorry if it’s not appropriate. But I felt I had to share. If it’s not ok, please delete mods."

It's an extremely sombering feeling knowing you're about to in just a few short days. My dear friend has been a mentor and working partner for the last 6 years of my career. She was diagnosed just last November with stage 3 breast cancer right after her 55th birthday and it's very unlikely she'll see her next one. It progressed to a very aggressive stage 4 in June. I was notified last night that her liver has stopped working so it's only a matter of time. I spoke with her partner this morning about me getting to go see her at the hospital as soon as possible and say goodbye, so I'm preparing for that. She is just the sweetest and easiest woman to love with the best laugh. I am going to miss her so so much. Thank you all for reading, this is one of the only places that I felt I could share."
memorynsunshine,1601776870,"As of writing this, I was diagnosed three days ago, but I feel like I'm not reacting enough?

As I (226f) write this it's Saturday evening, on Thursday morning I was diagnosed with Malignant Phyllodes Tumor, which I've also been told is case study levels of rare, at least for my age. Phyllodes tumors make up like 1% of all breast tumors, and they're mostly found in pre-menopausal women 40-50 yrs old. They have 3 grades, benign, borderline, and malignant, with malignant making up less than 10% of the tumors found.

I experienced rapid growth after a couple years, and by the time it was removed two weeks ago it was the size of a honeydew melon. I wear a US 28J, and my surgeon said it was 4/5 of what was under the skin. It was removed with ...wide excision? is what I think he called it, I don't know exactly what the depth of the margin was, but pathology confirmed that the entire margin was positive for cancer cells.

I've seen an oncologist, and she's sending me to a specialist at Mayo (jax campus), but all the doctors are very upset, and keep telling their office staff and nurses that my case is ""very urgent"", and she even said she'd be texting the specialist oncologist directly so that he can get me in as soon as possible. They have also said that it's so unlikely that it would be deadly that it's not something theyre worried about, but they want it out as soon as possible to avoid it spreading.

So far the expectation of a treatment plan (depending on the specialist's reccomendation) is that I'll have a bilateral mastectomy, as I've had fibroidadenomas in the other breast and given the propensity my tissue has already shown we don't want it to reoccur, and also the symmetry would be difficult to match, tbh. That will likely be followed by radiation (chemo is ineffective against these apparently), and a delayed reconstruction.

I just feel like I'm not... upset enough? I wasn't wholly surprised, to be honest, when I first realized it was growing so quickly I told my mum I though it might be cancer, and it just never felt ...right? Even after the surgery. My surgeon expressed surprise that I wasn't more upset when he told me, cause I did a little bit shut down, but since then I don't know if I'm not processing it or if I'm just .... not as upset as it seems many people are?  My mum said to my aunt earlier that I'm emotionally handling it better than they (my parents) are, and she's not really wrong? 

I have an extraordinary support system, and I still live with my parents. I have good insurance, and I work for a small company that already has been amazing. I'm already very grateful that even though I have to go through this, that I'm doing it at this point in my life. 

But, y'know, at the same time I feel like not being so upset about it is almost like not taking it seriously enough?

Does anyone have experience with Malignant Phyllodes Tumors, or just any...advice?"

This is super sensitive, it seems like most women on here have had mastectomy and I haven't read much about lumpectomy,  but then again I'm new. All my friends I've known,  same. I know lots of reasons for and against, but one thing not showing up in research is and I'm wondering if you had a lumpectomy how the physical results ended up.  Are you ok with results?  This basically boils down to a vanity question I guess.  That sounds shitty I know... ugh.... I'm leaving out details, type etc.  I'm weighing all factors but I would super appreciate real people feedback on the results . I will say tumor involved is 11mm because that could be consideration. 
 
I've been thinking it'll just be like the biopsy and not effect shape of breast and I realize that if  you're taking something out, how it'll look with a chunk removed. This is ONE factor so I'm not basing my decision on this it's a factor.

GurCake,1601644884,"Hi everyone. Freaking out a bit here, as might be expected having already gone through the breast cancer roller coaster. I have been having treatment for stage 2 IDC for the last year and on my initial CT scan 2 cysts were spotted in my ovaries (one on each). I wasn’t told about this at the time, not sure why. Only hearing about that for the first time today. I am also seeing a gynae for unrelated issues and she recently asked that I have a pelvic ultrasound just as a baseline test. 

Ultrasound done last week and today I got a call from the hospital to say I have one simple cyst on the left side and one complex cyst on the right and they are referring me back to the gynae for her views on next steps. The Dr who called me wouldn’t be drawn on whether or not this was something of concern, just said that they would send the results to my Dr for her opinion. I feel like I’m losing my mind at the moment worrying about this and I won’t hear from the gynaecologist until next week as she is on leave. 

Anyone gone through anything similar? I’m in a heap now back to the worst case scenarios I had at the start and wondering why they didn’t follow up on this a year ago after the CT."

trashov,1601594591,"Hey everyone! Been reading through this subreddit for awhile (thankful for this community for existing already) &amp; just need some advice on where to begin. 

My mother (52) just received news yesterday from her primary doctor that she has grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. We're all absolutely devastated, particularly because she's our rock (and she's my other half/best friend for the better part of 20+ years). I wish I would have taken a closer look at the findings of her biopsy report; the only other number I recall on the report was a 6/9 for the Bloom Richardson scale (which I'm assuming is how they came to the conclusion that it was grade 2). 

She has an appointment with an oncologist Monday, as well as the surgeon the same day later in the afternoon. We've already reached out for a referral to the nearest NCI cancer center hospital (we faxed out her paperwork this afternoon), so we're just trying to get a head start so things feel less rushed. 

My mother is a very timid woman - not the best with asking questions, sharing concerns outright, etc. - so I'm trying to compile some things that I ought to help her &amp; my father look out for. This is most of the information I've been able to receive from her because she's (obviously) very upset and so am I. 

What kind of questions should she be asking the oncologist? The surgeon? I won't be able to make every appointment with her because I'm in grad school, but I'm home for the time being and I need to be as supportive as I can. This woman is my best friend, and I want to keep my mother informed that this isn't an outright death sentence.

What are some ways that you wish people would support you in this journey? All the info I currently have is that she has it in two places in her right breast, near the inside and near the outside/armpit area. They told her stage zero initially and ordered a second biopsy of the outer area and that came back as cancer as well on Monday. Now they're saying mastectomy as this is a type that jumps around? If I am scared shitless at this I can't imagine how she's feeling at the idea of trying to tell her kids and handling all that is coming. I'd like to just know how to help make this easier on her and her family. Any help is appreciated. I know things will likely be ok but cancer is still cancer and it's tricky and it sucks.
Help?"
2MuchWineTonight,1601477040,"I work in retail and the place I work got cool lanyards that support Breast Cancer Awareness &amp; Research. Totally excited to wear it and my team was rocking it too (I'm not the only one who was affected by breast cancer). Super excited... Everyone is cool. Happy day.

So this lady, I'll call her Karen, comes up to me and yells at me for wearing the breast cancer lanyard. I'm like, ""Pardon me?"" She spouts off that it's not October yet and I should only be wearing it in October. I smile and say, ""Breast cancer awareness should be every month. We just got them in and we're excited to spread awareness."" Her response was rude, like I expected. She was like, ""Do you even know anyone with breast cancer??"" With my greatest bitch face look, under a mask of course, I say, ""Yes, I do know someone"".  I go into some basic facts about breast cancer awareness and smile.  She was like, ""Yeah right, you are too young to know anyone with it."" WTF are you talking about lady?! I'm 41. I know people in their 20's with it. 

Now I'm not going to give her the satisfaction that it was me, 5 of my coworkers and 20+ employee family members that have battled breast cancer or actively battling it.   She rattled off how breast cancer is like a conspiracy because do many people have it. Oh and that I'm trying to get likes on Facebook for it. Uh, okay, I don't even have Facebook but whatever. I ask her if she needs any help with anything else and bid her a good day... All while smiling under my mask with my resting bitch face. 

I hope she stayed mad the entire trip in the store because literally everyone was wearing a lanyard.  That Karen was pure evil."
notpciguru,1601431442,"Hey all,

Just had mammogram/ultrasound about 4-5 months ago due to discovering a fairly large lump. Thankfully it was determined to be a cyst and I was recommended to hold off on draining due to risk of infection and the situation with Covid.

Now, it still hasn’t gone away (but does seem to have gotten smaller). I have become more paranoid ever since that incident. I’m now noticing what seems to be a very slight dimple/dent on the edge of the same breast (basically on the edge of the breast to my chest). I have no idea if that’s always been there, caused by the cyst, or something completely different. Not sure if this is worth scheduling another appointment for."
rrjs,1601417124,"I am still reading up on what all of this means. No one in my family has ever had cancer before. Her doctor is recommending 6 months of chemo, then surgery - either lumpectomy or masectomy, too soon to tell what she will need - then radiation. I am in shock. My life is about to change so much and I am trying to wrap my head around it. I know that I am going to need some support with this, but I do not know where to go. I don't think I would enjoy a support group. Are there counselors or therapists trained in this sort of thing?"

TransportThestral,1601374127,"I'm so tired. My fucking expander has an infection. 

I came to the hospital on Sunday, didn't get a bed until 2.30am, didn't fall asleep until 4, and get blasted by light for rounds at 5.30. Going to have to do emergency surgery to clean and maybe remove my expander. Super. 11am rolls around nurse says ""you're off npo, they're not able to take you back today"". Greaaaatttt. Yum, hospital food.

Ask nurse for pain meds at 8.30p so I can sleep, she brings them at 9. The MA comes in a fucking hour later to do vitals. Then the nurse again at midnight. And then my IV box beeps me awake at 2.30a. Finally fall back asleep, nurse is back at 4 adding more antibiotics, then hello blast of light at 5.30 again. Like I get it, they have to do their jobs and shit, but at least fucking consolidate some of it!

I need to find something to rage about because the 30 minutes of sobbing and feeling sorry for myself just plugged my nose up and made me more miserable. I'm so tired of treatment and surgery and being allergic to every fucking med they try and give me. I'm sick of peeing out my butt, which has been made worse by the antibiotics. Hospital toilet paper is the worst, and they have no peri bottles here (wtf?). 

I just wanted one thing to go right. But no, 2 months later, here we are with infection. I'm electing for DIEP, so I'm hoping my surgeon will do it without reinstalling another expander.

Oh, and I'm alone of course. My husband is home with the kids, my family all lives out of state. His parents have lost their minds to Covid and won't even babysit (even though I only go to the cancer center and my husband works alone).

I just want a hug.

My GI doctor sent me for a CT on my stomach and I had to go to the imaging center.  While I was waiting..  like 3 women came and went for mammograms.   I'm 40.  Hadn't had my 1st mammogram yet so I jokingly said: I'll get one too if you can ""squeeze  me in"".  We all laughed..  haha.  

Well. They could and  hat was 10 days ago.  They immediately got me in for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound for two separate spots on my right breast.  That was 5 days ago.  Today I had two biopsies.  One under ultrasound.  One in the chair with guided mammography.  (Holy suck fest.)

Anyway...  I know this violates the rules of the sub because I don't have cancer- YET.  It is very suspicious.   I just want to make it a point to say:  Ladies!  If you are 40-  they will ""squeeze"" you in.   Go get one.  I did it on impulse.  And I am Hella glad I did.

My 41st birthday is Friday and that's when I can expect the results from the biopsies today.  And I am still messing around with my stomach and scheduled for an endoscopy Wednesday.  Good times.  Good times....  sucks getting old.

skello-kitty,1601335913,"I discovered a lump in my right breast over a month ago and went and got it checked. The doctor felt around a bit but I felt it was kind of half-assed (she just poked each breast like 3-5 times, no deep pressure, no circular motions etc) and told me it was probably just my ribcage that I was feeling. So I didn't get a referral to get a mammogram. Upon hearing this, my mom got angry and called them and demanded that I get a referral because she was very worried (and that clinic has a very poor reputation so she doubted the thoroughness of the exam). So I got the referral even though I wasn't supposed to have it. I've been considering booking off the time for the mammogram which is in 2 days. I've thoroughly done a self-exam and I can feel bumpiness (one slightly big, smooth &amp; hard bump slightly under my nipple), but I can't pinpoint whether it's my ribs or not. It probably is, but if I'm not 100% sure, what should I do? I'm not that scared of the procedure itself, but I'm scared of being scoffed at/patronized because I am only 19 and maybe it even says in the referral that I am not supposed to be there :S"

tightpants09,1601248618,"Hey everyone!

So I’m not sure if this is an okay place to post this, but I’ve been trying to do some research to help my girlfriend out and I’m at a loss of where to go or what terms to even search for. 

My girlfriend is coming up on 2 years cancer free this next month. She’s told me a few times that her cancer has a chance of recurring in the next five years, so plastic surgeons won’t help her at all. 

That doesn’t sound quite right to me, but that’s also why I’m here. I’m just not sure what to do to find more information or if this was something that was told to her because of insurance or if there’s somewhere else to turn. 

Anyways..she breaks down a lot over it. It’s really hard to convince her that she’s still gorgeous and she has the hardest time finding tops that she feels comfortable in. We’re supposed to go to a wedding in a couple weeks and each time she’s tried to find a dress, it becomes something that upsets her and makes her feel deformed. 

I personally won’t see her different in any way regardless of she’s able to get a restoration or not, but it kills me to see her struggle with a piece of her body that’s now gone. 

Has anyone had experience with surgeons saying no to restoration because there’s a chance for the cancer to come back?

Are there any women that have had experience post-mastectomy that have any advice about clothing that helped them? Are there any kind of bras that might help her feel more balanced? 

I just want to do anything I can to help her. I’m incredibly lucky to have even gotten to meet her and she doesn’t deserve to feel like this."

TheManInTheShack,1601104276,"I just found this subreddit and have been reading many difficult posts. Some of you have just been told you have breast cancer. My wife is approaching the tail end of it and I thought I was tell you our story to provide perhaps a little hope. 

My wife noticed a lump last February that had not been there the month before. We immediately got a mammogram. The radiologist said he was 90% sure its was breast cancer. We had a biopsy done then met with a breast surgeon. There was a large mass in one breast. The oncologist said she was at stage 3B or 4. We were told that she would need weekly chemo for 4 months (the “red devil” - the hard stuff) followed by surgery followed by another year of chemo. 

A few days before chemo was to start, the breast surgeon called to say that another pathologist had reviewed her film and tissue samples and determined that she did not have the type of cancer they originally thought. A second pathologist had agreed. The original pathologist then reluctantly agreed that he had been wrong. Instead of being stage 3 or 4, she was stage 1. 

The surgeon told us to cancel the chemo and that we would be going directly to surgery. She had a double mastectomy with flap reconstruction. She then went through 12 weeks of taxol and Herceptin and is now on just Herceptin every 3 weeks for 9 months. 

The reason for the change in stage was that the large mass turned out to be non-aggressive cancer. There was a tiny spot or two of aggressive cancer but it hadn’t gone anywhere yet. 

The breast surgeon was surprised because she said that the non-aggressive cancer shouldn’t be palpable at this point. The oncologist apologized for the rollercoaster as this just never happens. This non-aggressive cancer grew incredibly rapidly such that my wife noticed it but the aggressive cancer had yet to grow much at all. 

Had that not happened, she could have easily found out when it had already spread to other organs. 

At this rate, once she finishes chemo, the odds of reoccurrence are extremely low. 

We really dodged a bullet and for that I will be forever grateful. I went from thinking I might lose my wife of 21 years to feeling very confident she will survive this.

The surgery and recovery were the difficult part. The chemo was not bad because we didn’t have to go through the Red Devil.

For those of you that are just starting this fight, don’t give up. You never know what might be around corner."

bibimbapcouch,1601069940,"This past month has been super stressful. Last month, I (19F) found a small, \~2cm lump on my right breast, very close to my nipple. It's not visible, but it is palpable. There was slight pain that comes an goes, but that was about it. I did not hesitate and immediately scheduled an appointment to get it checked.  
My doctor gave me a physical breast exam and told me that ""it does not feel concerning"" because she could barely feel it herself. However, she still referred me to get an ultrasound since it was hurting.

A few days after my exam, the pain seemed to go away. Two weeks later, I had my ultrasound. I got my ultrasound results last week. In my ultrasound report, it stated that I had a ""hypoechoic mass with an irregular shape and irregular border 1.5x2.3x1.8, Bi-Rads 4A: Suspicious irregular abnormality, biopsy recommended."" Reading that, I immediately panicked and scheduled my biopsy right away.

The days leading up to my biopsy, I was super anxious. The words ""irregular"" ""suspicious"" and ""abnormal"" just clouded my mind so much. I kept thinking to myself, *what if I do have cancer?*

I had my biopsy a week after I got my results. I was super nervous about the procedure and how it was gonna feel. From stories that I read online, a lot of people said that there might be a little pain and pressure, but it's not that bad.

I just had my biopsy 2 days ago (9/23). Before my procedure, I asked the doctor about my ultrasound report and if it really looked suspicious. He replied, ""it was actually hard to tell what the lump looked like. Since you're young, you have very dense breasts, so it doesn't show up well on the ultrasound. because of that, we have to do a biopsy."" That response calmed me a bit, but I was also disappointed because I wish the report would have just said that the lump was hard to see, instead of all those scary words.

They did a core needle biopsy + guided ultrasound and it was way worse than I expected. They numbed me w/ local anesthesia, but it wasn't enough. It was super freakin painful and I was crying so much. Every time they turned the vacuum on, I would get shocked by this intense, sharp pain in my nipple. It was borderline torture. my biopsy was also quite long too. They had a hard time trying to collect good samples because my breasts were super dense and the lump kept moving around, so they tried to get several samples (i think they got about 12 samples).

After the biopsy was over, I laughed and cried in relief because that was the most painful procedure I've ever had.

My doctor also said that since they had a hard time getting samples, it might not be good enough for the pathologist to examine. So if that becomes the case, then I'll have to have surgery to get the lump removed and examined. And honestly, I think I would have much preferred that then the biopsy...

So now, it is 2 days after my biopsy and I am awaiting results, which should come within a week. I am extremely anxious. I have no family history of any cancer, but I have a hard time processing the possibility that I could have breast cancer at 19 years old. I know someone who was diagnosed with breast cancer when they were 22, and 19 and 22 aren't that big of an age difference.

I don't know... I am super scared. I will keep you updated soon."

Got the call yesterday that the Margins still came back as showing cancer cells so is going to need to go in for surgery 3 and she has chosen a bi-lateral mastectomy.     
   
She is leaning towards doing direct to implant if she can and has ruled out flap surgeries.  She doesn't mind going smaller and the cancer is right side only currently (dcis and idc  er+ pr+ her-) I think if direct to implant is not possible she may go flat but not sure yet. Her post op from the re-excision is Monday and plastic surgeon appt Monday afternoon so we can get her options and the next steps scheduled.   

I was hoping some of you may be able to chime in on your experiences.     

Did any of you have direct to implant reconstruction and if so were you happy with your choice or anybody wish they hadn't gone that route.   

I've already ordered some iron in pockets for drain bulbs. We have several passport lanyards to use for showers.  We're going pj shopping for some more comfortable button up pjs for her. We have body pillows from the first two surgeries which have been helpful to her.  I have the lights that she normally uses set up with voice control to turn on off so she doesn't have to reach switches. I set her laptop up on an articulating arm near her normal spot so she doesn't have to lift-just swings the arm into position so it can kind of hang where she wants it. 

I'm trying to make things as easy as can be (for what it is) and make sure I can do whatever I can to ease things for her.

I posted the thread of “worst way to find out” about my cancer diagnosis. (The one where I found out I have cancer through an automated message of the oncologist referral).

I moved to Illinois recently, and I am not familiar with the area, so I am having trouble finding a doctor for a mammogram. My insurance is Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, but since I live in Illinois I am worried if I will be billed differently, or if finding a doctor who will accept my insurance will be challenging. Any advice? I do not really have any family members to ask, my paternal aunt had breast cancer, but I cannot ask her any questions due to issues, so I have turned to the internet!"
masksonpeople,1600578526,"Hello everyone, just a brief summary of what’s been going on... I (30F) noticed a lump for a few months off but didn’t think much of it until my husband noticed it two months ago and strongly encouraged me to get it checked out. My primary doctor shrugged me off but ordered a mammogram and ultrasound anyway. I called the breast center to get it scheduled but they wouldn’t book me for 3-4 months out due to my young age so I went in person and told them my situation and got it scheduled within 2 weeks.

9/18/20 I got an automated phone call from the hospital saying that a referral got approved and it’s for a doctor whose name I do not recognize. I googled the name and it’s an oncologist....

My appointment with the breast surgeon isn’t until Monday afternoon but I have been bawling all weekend after the automated message phone call...

RoseyTreatsBakery,1600560898,"Hi Guys!  
My name is Caryle Rose and I run RoseyTreatsBakery on Etsy. For Breast cancer awareness month this year I am planning on donating a portion of proceeds (from my breast cancer cookie sets) to a breast cancer research charity. I will be donating 35% of the proceeds but I am having conflicted thoughts on the charity I should do. Every time I think I find a charity there seems to be some type of 'problematic history' or a bad finance reports (like more money going to marketing / advertising then actual research). 

If anyone knows what a strongly reliable charity is I would love to hear it!

Thank you in advance!"

medditor17,1600547280,"Hi everyone, in 2013 my mother was diagnosed with stage 2b breast cancer. After undergoing chemo, radiation, and surgery she was given the all clear. Recently, at 52, after experiencing back pain she underwent a nuclear bone scan showing evidence of mets in the skull, ribs, clavicle, shoulders, spine, and hip. All of her follow up labs and bone density scans have been normal up until this point. She had her first appointment with the med onc this week who ordered a full body CT to get some more info. We are waiting on the results of those, but initial impression of the first appointment was seemingly optimistic. Her first cancer was Her2 -, Er +, PR+ so the oncologist explained the benefits of Ibrance to us. She has not had any shortness of breath or neurologic symptoms and seemed otherwise healthy until we got this shock diagnosis. Has anyone been in a similar spot? What are the chances that it is in her organs too and what should we expect in terms of a prognosis at this point?"
lost-vulpecula,1600544932,"Okay, so I'm brand new to this sub and things are pretty intense, so I'm here for some support, understanding, and maybe some help moving forward. The story so far is this (on mobile so sorry if formatting is trash):

About two months ago I discovered a breast lump which started a whirlwind ride of my first ever (27F) mammogram, ultrasound, double biopsy and finally diagnosis. Stage 3 ductal carcinoma. Things were rocky to begin with, as I have a seven year old autistic child, but I was fairly optimistic and just kind of going through the motions to get things moving in the right direction. Chemo was discussed, 6 cycles every 21 days of 4 types to deal with hormone positive and HER2 positive tumors. We finally got to the first round of chemo on the 10th, eight and a half hours of being throttled in the chair.

This is when things got bad. My body responded horribly, from an aggressive rash, mouth blisters, nausea beyond the ability to control with anti-nausea that resulted in getting fluids every day for a week and, at the end, required a hospital stay that gave me a brand new diagnosis of PTSD. Have started mood stabilizers, am feeling slightly on the better, but now I'm living in horror of the next cycle.

The quality of life change dropped so drastically that I kept thinking to myself I'd rather die or just have the cancer than do chemo again - my team wasn't listening to my symptoms, complaints, and experiences until they finally admitted me to the hospital. Even now my oncologist is hesitant to make any changes to the chemo regiment, and I'm trying to explain to her that I sincerely cannot survive the same effects again.

I'm scared and upset, because I went into this thinking I could fight and be strong, but when it hit, it didn't feel like fighting at all - it felt like being thrown into a boxing ring with no hands, and told to just survive as I got beaten slowly to death. I know this is dramatic, I know there are others with so much worse, but I can't figure out how to do that again, not just once, but 5 more times (possibly 6).

I'm just looking for something, I'm not really sure what..but I figured I would try here since there's nothing to lose. I'm sorry if this is horrible, sorry if it breaks rules, I just don't know what else to do."

Vikingjenn,1600458700,"I was first diagnosed with stage 3a, three days before my 35th birthday. Everything started moving too fast. I got scheduled for my port surgery the following week to prepare for the intravenous chemotherapy that started as soon as I healed from the surgery. I had 8 weeks of “intense” chemo, then a 2nd round of chemo for 20 weeks. I had a double mastectomy on Dec 23rd, 2016. Then I had 6 1/2 weeks of radiation. I was in remission on March 17th, 2017. 

I had a CT scan in April 2019 at the VA Hospital Hampton. Unfortunately the scan showed a spot on my pelvis. That’s the worst news for someone who thought they beat the disease but that feeling was replaced with anger because I was not informed until September 2019; five full months since the scan. Apparently they feel like I should have called to follow up on the CT scan and it was solely my responsibility to set up an appointment to review the results. My oncologist ordered a bone scan which revealed a spot on my neck. I also had a PET scan at the end of October. My oncologist called and asked if I could come in the following day. I was not able to get there and he got frustrated so he told me, right there on the phone, while I was getting passports for my 4 boys for our Germany trip, that the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes, my liver, and my lung. I was so upset. My oncologist should have taken these steps back in April or May or as soon as the results from the CT scan were ready. There is a chance that if we had acted as soon as they found the spot then the cancer might not have spread as severely as it did. Because of this egregious error and lack of concern that I felt from the Hampton VA, especially the radiology and oncology departments, I decided to seek care from the Virginia Oncologist Association who treated my brother-in-law with great success. 

After the diagnosis I went to my PCP, whom I know cares a great deal for me, to ask for his guidance. He ordered an MRI of the brain. More bad news and the scariest of my cancer discoveries to date: The radiological oncologist had counted and said that “conservatively, there are 30 to 40 lesions in my brain. To top that off, two of the larger tumors were on my optic chiasm. If they get any larger the tumors could press on the nerve and I could go blind. The doctors were surprised that I didn't have a seizure or headaches or blurry vision, I was essentially asymptomatic. 

So, I had to have whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) because it was too widespread for surgery and we needed to do this immediately. There were three typical results from WBRT for someone with my diagnosis. The WBRT was going to do little to nothing, it could slow the progress down, or it might be highly effective. I crossed my fingers for the 66% chance that the WBRT would do something, anything. They made my mask and I had 10 days of radiation. During this time, I also started on some high strength chemo pills and steroids. The steroids led to a very painful thrush; so painful that I could barely drink water. The only thing I could tolerate for food was the coldest possible fruit smoothie and that still hurt. I had non-stop diarrhea. I felt completely wiped out. Feeling exhausted and with no energy from my diet, I had a lot working against me. I had stopped eating regular meals and ate plain ice.

On the 10th day of radiation I woke up excited for the last day of treatment.  Later that day I wasn’t feeling well so I layed down for a nap. My whole body started shaking and I kept feeling worse. My PCP office called to check in on me as my husband was taking my temperature. They stayed on the line to find out that I had a fever of 102 so the nurse put the doctor on the line and he told us to get to the emergency room immediately. I then went into septic shock and they didn't think I was going to make it. But I survived. I spent nearly a month in the hospital. I lost a lot of weight and strength from laying in a bed barely eating anything for that long. I had to learn to walk with a walker. I used the walker to help me for about 3 or 4 months. Still get wobbly, but I try to take little walks. 

In January 2020, I had gamma knife radiation. I lost all my hair from that procedure. My hair is coming back now but, in the gamma knife spot, my hair grows in thin and the rest of it is thick.

In July, we discovered that the cancer moved into my liver. So now it's everywhere... Bones, lungs, brain, and liver.

I am on my third treatment plan. I get a shot in my belly and 2 in the butt, with pills. I've been very sick. I do have ups. I started making headbands to raise money for metastatic breast cancer research.

But recently, I have been throwing up, diarrhea, low blood pressure, and sleep all the time. Next month, October, I'll have a scan to see where I the numbers are at with the new treatment.

This has been a rough year. My husband stopped working in December to take care of me. Covid 19 pandemic... And my cancer. My Germany trip had to be canceled.

Started last week with not wearing my prosthetics. I feel great about it, I feel free now that they're gone. I am stretching everyday. I smoke a lot of weed, and take CBD. I am also on a pain patch because of my bones.

I am scared to see what the next scan is going to say."
StTuRu,1600432979,"I posted after my initial diagnosis (Dcis w/microinvasion on the right side) but am finalizing my surgery decision this week.

In 2008 I had a (benign) fibroadenoma on the right.

In 2014 I had 2 surgeries on the left side to remove a phyllodes tumor (benign, low-intermediate grade). They also found ADH on the left.

Now- current diagnosis on right, also small fibroadenoma on right.

Wondering whether bilateral mastectomy is a good choice. I understand overall survival is the same for my treatment choices. Surgeon says it’s up to me- all options are good, though he thinks higher risk of recurrence with lumpectomy or single mastectomy.

I’m 36 and all my genetic tests came back normal. If I didn’t have the prior history, I’d think the double would be overkill.  But really trying to avoid a recurrence or even having to go in for biopsy after biopsy (time, worry, and $). 

Anyone experience something similar?"
CapableJellyfish2,1600428680,"I’m on my sixth and hopefully last chemo! Yay! The tumor is now 1/3 of the original size 7mm!

Then to the rant part :D

This summer and fall have been so boooring I just want to have surgery and be over with this. (Well I will still have 14 rounds of herceptin but it’s not as bad as the other two I’m having now)

What sucks is that my doctor could not give any definite answers. Like will this really be last or will there be two more rounds or when exactly will the surgery be. I am young, I have life to live and work to organise dammit!

My care has actually been organized by two hospitals, the closer one has taken care of chemo and following my synthoms and chemo’s effects and the other one is respossible for planing the care and does the surgery. So my Doctor here can only recomend that this is enough and surgery should be done as soon as I have recovered from this round.

So frustraiting! but I have myself to plame as I felt that this way I get better treatment. It is just hard to plan what I shold I train my substitute to do,  When I don’t know if the surgery will be in three or four weeks or perhaps two months from now.

ckb12345678,1600210475,So I’m almost done with radiation and when I’m finished I am supposed to start five years of tamoxifen. The medical oncologist said that they are leaning more towards having ppl take it even when the cancer is ER- and wants me to take it. The radiation oncologist who I like quite a bit did not seem to be a fan of the idea. Are any of you taking it after having ER- and if so how did your doctor explain it? I have bipolar 1 disorder and managing the mood symptoms is challenging. From what I hear about tamoxifen it could add a whole new level to an already difficult fight. I’m not sure that’s something I want to take on if the benefit is minimal.

They haven’t got back to me yet so I assume it’s okay. 

I found out a few days later that my mom got diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, she is going to have surgery to take it out and radiation. I think because it’s stage 1 she’s going to be okay but I’m still scared. She doesn’t have any family history of it, eats healthy, lives a healthy lifestyle but thinks it was caused by stress and 6 years of hormone replacement therapy.
 
Because of this recent finding, I am assuming I should get checked every year even while young? 
My main question is will the radiation from the mammogram increase my chance of breast cancer?

Also the nurse said she doesn’t know why the doctor sent me for a mammogram and not just an ultra sound because I am young so it’s hard to see anything."
purritowraptor,1600168937,"My boyfriend's mum was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer yesterday. Because of COVID concerns they told her over the phone so the information isn't very clear. It's the kind caused by hormones, but she doesn't know if she's HER+ or HER-. For now, they're just giving her Letrozole to stop it from growing and possibly shrink it. The doctor said it should be ""as effective as chemo"" in shrinking it, but I can't find any use of Letrozole being used for that especially as a sole front line treatment. They said that they'll do that for 6 months max and then do surgery, but if it's clear it's not helping within a month or two they'll go straight for a lumpectomy or mastectomy. So far no chemo or upfront surgery has been offered.

Is this normal and/or safe? We want to trust their medical opinion but we are really worried that they're offering an estrogen inhibitor as her first and only treatment. My aunt was diagnosed with stage 1 HER+ breast cancer and she was treated with surgery and chemo immediately, with hormone inhibitors as a maintenance treatment for the next 10 years. She's in the US though and my bf's mum is in the UK, so the course of treatments might be different. Anyway, anyone have thoughts or experience with this? Should we be advocating for a more aggressive course of treatment, or should it be fine as long as she's being closely monitored?"

But I just got a call about my genetic test results and found out that I do have a mutation called CHEK2. The genetic counselor said this makes the lifetime risk 28-37% likelihood of being diagnosed with breast cancer, which would explain my diagnosis at the age of 29...

Questions I have are:
Has anyone else had this mutation along with a BC diagnosis? 
Did it change or influence your decision when it came time for surgery? (Mastectomy vs. bilateral mastectomy). Or your decision for radiation ? (Have seen online that excess risk of developing cancer in the other breast can be linked with those that had radiation for their first breast cancer)

The counselor said that it may put me at an increased risk of the cancer coming back, or on the opposite side. But she’s unaware of exactly what that risk is because it’s still being studied and is not as well known as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes."

Based on this pathological degree, what kind of chemotherapy should be the best? Due to the high dosage that Chinese domestic doctors generally apply to patients. She is a little worried because there is no data that can be found to support these things. For example, how many cancer cells have entered the circulation? How many could be killed after chemotherapy? My apology if there’s any confusion caused by my translation, your advice will be much appreciated, Thank you so much,"
Albertbailey,1600029652,"Hello all,
My mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer...my mom is my rock..my hero(shall I say)...she worked so hard to provide a stable life fory sister and I growing up.
Now that she is retired and her and my father have a chance to relax and enjoy their lives ....this horrible diagnosis.
I am unsure of how to help her or what to do for her.
I feel like I cry every time I talk to her and I know that won't help her.
So I am looking to the breast cancer survivor community for suggestions on 1st and foremost how to be a stronger person for my mom, but also I just want to hear how you felt when you got the diagnosis or when your loved one was diagnosed.
Thank you xx"
Koalio15733,1600029291,"Hi guys, I'll be having a double mastectomy next year. Chemo sucks btw. So I have a choice between the two reconstructions. I am leaning more towards the tummy tuck option as I am not a small girl. Reducing the stomach seems like an added bonus for me, and my plastic surgeon thinks that I am an excellent candidate for it. 

So, for everyone that has had the option, which one did you choose and may I ask why? Has anyone here had the tummy tuck and how are you with the results? Thank you in advance!"

Ulaya,1600025349,"Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with grade 3 BC (ER-, PR-, HER2+), and I’ve been in a tsunami of emotions ever since. I’m about to start chemo for a period of 6 months, then surgery, and amidst all my fears I’m mostly scared that I might lose my boyfriend in the process. 

It’s not in my nature to be clingy in relationships, but I have been feeling uncharacteristically needy, while he seems distant to me (though he denies that). I can’t help but repeatedly ask whether we will get through this together, and if he will still love me post-chemo and surgery. Perhaps it should be the least of my concerns right now, but amidst all the uncertainty it’s what worries me the most. 

We’ve been together for 10 months, have had a good and active relationship so far, and were slowly thinking of building a family together. Now everything has suddenly changed, and I’m terrified of what might come next. 

How has BC impacted your relationships? What has helped? How do you cope with insecurities of this sort? Are they ‘normal’ or a sign that something might already be broken? Is it healthy to express them to our partners or should we quell them ourselves? 

Many thanks in advance for any insight you may have 🙏"

shadow-wolf37,1600009039,"Hey all, it’s been a rough couple years to say the least. To give you a little backstory... 
(I apologize for the length of the post)

I lost my Mom 2 years ago to lung cancer. Then was diagnosed myself with lung cancer (carcinoid tumor) about a year ago. I was having random swelling/cellulitis on and off (mostly in my limbs), I figured I was just allergic to something. But one time it happened so badly and my hand/arm swelled up so I went to the hospital. They were trying to figure out the cause and decided to give me a chest CT to rule out something rheumatological that usually showed up in the lymph nodes of the chest. Did not find that, instead found a tumor in my R lung. So last October I had a R lower lobectomy. 

Fast forward to a year since my surgery, I had my 2nd 6 month follow up CT scan on my chest. Lung is fine, but a couple subpectoral lymph nodes have slightly grown and they noticed a spot on my R breast... 

After testing/core biopsy was told it is IDC, grade 2. DCIS is present with grade 2 features and a “predominantly cribriform architectural pattern”.  It is ER+(90%) and PR+(20%). HER2 was originally equivocal but after FISH test was told that was negative. Had a PET scan and have not seen results yet but my medical oncologist said that it has not metastasized, but is most likely in a couple lymph nodes in my arm pit and subpectoral lymph nodes could be involved. 

My medical oncologist presented my case to the tumor board and she says that they believe I should have chemo to start, given through a port that I’m supposed to have put in thursday. I’m following up with her the day before to learn more about chemo, but of course I’m trying to panic-research and make sure this is the best course of action. I’m guessing since the tumor is almost 2 inches and is irregular in shape, they want to try and shrink it down first. If nothing changes with chemo it sounds like I’ll be having a mastectomy since my surgeon said I wouldn’t be pleased with the cosmetic outcome if they did a lumpectomy. Will also probably be doing hormone therapy and radiation.. 

I guess I’m asking advice if anyone had a similar diagnosis. What was your treatment/outcome? Did they biopsy lymph nodes in the armpit first? I’m going through fertility appointments now to try and freeze eggs first. But after that I’m guessing treatment will happen fast so I’m trying to prepare myself mentally and learn as much as I can first to know I’m making the best decision. Safe to say, I’m overwhelmed. 

Any insight would be appreciated !"
2MuchWineTonight,1600007169,"I got my expanders removed and silicone implants put in this past Tuesday. I was so excited to get my new boobs. I hated the expanders because they were hard as rocks and didn't move. I couldn't contain my excitement. I woke up afterwards and was covered with gauze and padding inside my ugly compression bra. No worries, I was excited to see them. It was late Wednesday when I took my first look at my new boobs and I cried. I don't like them. I don't know why. They just look different than I imagined.

Maybe it's because they're not how I imagined they'd be. Maybe they need time to settle into shape? The front of them are flatter than I imagined. I thought they'd be more perky. I know I'm constantly wearing my compression bra until further notice. They're bigger than my natural boobs. I was an A cup now I'm a B cup (I think). I'm just.... Not happy.

Did any of you feel this way when you got your replacements?  Does it feel more normal after a few months? I am looking for some insight on this.

Thanks everyone."
moonset57,1600002964,"I am a college student and due to the pandemic, am stuck at home since almost six months till whenever my college reopens (which could take 6 more months). 
And my home, in all honestly, is no less than a torturous place. My father provides for all of us but he (I believe) has narcissistic personality disorder. And he talks ill of my mom on one hand and on the other hand, takes her to her appointments. My elder brother who is 28, fights with my mother and shows no mercy to her health. 
My father and I are not on talking terms as he spoke ill of my mom when she was in the hospital, getting operated. I spoke back to him and we haven't been talking since a month. 
Today, matters escalated as both my brother and my father shouted at my mom who is very weak and frail right now. 

They have no regards to her health. I have read the stories of cancer survivers and how a healthy home environment helped them so much. I feel extremely bad about the fact that my mom is having a very tough time at home instead. I try my best to provide her with emotional support, but sometimes I myself am at my worst, holed up in my room and bawling my eyes out. 

I spoke to one of my uncles and planned to send mom to her mother's place so that she can live peacefully and can be taken care of but her chemotherapy has begun and she has to complete all her sessions from this place only, meaning that she is stuck in this highly toxic environment for the next 6-7 months. 

She is a very strong woman but today I saw her crying when my brother shouted at her and he kept on shouting despite the fact that she can't take so much stress. I feel so helpless. Had I been working and independent, I would have taken her somewhere else to live with me. Every second spent here feels painful. But I really don't know what to do. 

I could really use some advice. Thank you."

n72faith,1599869079,"Hi everyone. My dear friend just started a podcast where she will be sharing stories from her journey surviving breast cancer. She just hit her 5 year mark after being diagnosed with stage 1 triple-negative breast cancer, which is one of the most aggressive forms.  It's her first podcast, so the production is a bit rough around the edges, but her story is very compelling. She plans to share much of what she learned along the way about caring for herself, through her diagnosis, double mastectomy, and reconstruction, especially about how it impacted her body image  and sense of feminine identity and sexuality - things most people don't want to talk about. 

She and I have talked extensively about this and I think she has so much wonderful insight that would be incredibly helpful to anyone currently on their own journey or walking beside someone who is.  The first episode is only 23 minutes long, so not a big time investment.  I  hope  you give it a listen. Thank you for your time.

I’ve recently been gene tested for the BRCA1 gene which runs in my family. It’s been very aggressive on my mother’s side, causing her to lose 3 sisters to breast cancer.

I get my results in a couple days. If I do carry the gene I’ll likely have a preventative double mastectomy with a reconstructive surgery. Has anyone undergone this? What was your experience/results?

I’ll also add that my mother had a preventative double mastectomy in 1991.Her reconstructive surgery was a disaster, doc left gauze in her which led to infection nearly costing her her life. I realize things have improved but I’m very scared as this is the only story I’ve heard of the procedure(s).

Another question[U.S. resident specific]: does the women’s health and cancer rights act of 1998 mean that, because I have insurance, the preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery will be covered?

In June she was diagnosed with stage 2 HER+ noninvasive carcinoma (9 tumors were removed in july). By the end of July she was cancer free and continued her RED DEVIL treatment (which she had lost no hair). September third was going to be her last chemo treatment where she would ring the bell.

They did a STAT biopsy and the next day her doctors diagnosed her with stage 3A invasive Carcinoma in both breast. She will begin a new chemo twice a week now. I hate that I think this way...I just don't see how someone can develop more cancer while on chemo and in a 7 day time span. she said that the new tumors were too deep for the previous scan to see.

akikohaylin,1599627989,"I get asked that question daily. Really no, none of this was worth it, it all sucked. But inquiring minds want to know so let's dish about my reconstruction.  this will be just recon. I won't rehash the bullshit of ""oh my god you are getting a FREE boob job"", ""finally getting the boobs you wanted"", ""are you going bigger"", ""no more saggy boobs"" because I will just get angry and no one likes angry Janessa . Plus we all know that is utter nonsense. See a boob job is a choice we did not choose this and it comes at us full force. Recon from breast cancer is different they scrap you to 1% of breast tissue, rads effect how that expander sits too. Your body is going through a trauma and trying to adjust. Now add your mind set or your mind wrapped in cancer, completely different than a boob job. 
The you have cancer comment happens then almost immediately after it is the ""do you know a plastic surgeon?"" I think our issue starts there. Why do we push right to recon? Our body is about to go into major overhaul adding this element is something I think is more pushed by society. Think about it, the first and most important is to remove the cancer. Just that surgery is intense and takes a toll on our body. The drains, the removal of the breast, the exhaustion and the mental part. Add a foreign object and what the actual f$^k just happened. Then there is rads making it all a big ass mess. Recon should come later but it does not. In retro spec I would have gone flat and fabulous to heal mentally and physically then done recon. I am not anti recon only on Brideplasty that show pisses me off.
The recon started right at mastectomy with expanders was difficult. They felt like a squeaky toy inserted in my body. Then with the fills, ugh.  I felt nausea set in and pain like a hard work out, do able but with everything else it sucked. There is a metal piece that they use to find the part for the needle to inject the saline in, seriously read that again that is in our body!  I set off the metal detector at a Best Buy and had to explain to the security guards, they were freaked out I was amused. The expanders were a bitch-uncomfortable and odd. Just didn't know what to make of them. I think watching your body change before your eyes is a mind screw too. Cancer messes with you on the inside but you can not see it this you watched literally. Looking back I know I joked about it but I  think it was hard to watch yourself change like that.

Then you have the expander itself. Hard, unmovable, lifeless thing inserted into your body. CRAZY! Now do not get me wrong it works for some, not for me. I hated it Zipping up a dress they didn't move and that got me for some reason made it so sad to me. Granted they shifted into my arm pits, not a good look. I remember when I went into the plastics office the first time and asked for a tram surgery she laughed at me, rude! I weighed 157 pounds and was fit and healthy she told she couldn't find anything to make even one breast from that is why they made me do expanders first. It was such an alien invasion for me but everyone kept telling me how great they looked I didn't see it nor did I feel it.
I asked about the DIEP because now thank you cancer you dirty devil it gave me 17 pounds and I could. I was warned of the surgery but knew what it was because I had done my research and talk to many who had it. I was mentally prepared, I really believe that is why I did so well this time. My head was ready for a 12 hour surgery, 3 days in ICU, 3 days in the hospital, 3 weeks resting, months recovering, and  another surgery to follow. Do not be fooled by the tummy tuck bull shit this is not what this operation is about so do not go in thinking that. I felt like using part of me was like taking two back from cancer, hahaha I was a thief in the night and was going to get myself back. Dumb to some but to me I needed this.

Then comes the revisions. ALL of my friends told me the lipo was the worse part. See with this surgery you get what someone (who the hell was it I would like to know) dubbed ""dog ears"" on your hips. Its from crap settling after and you need adjusting. So every time my doctor would try to explain but Janessa you are having.... I would reply I know the lipo is the worse. 
After reading all that do you think recon is easy? NO! Will it be worth it? I won't answer that. It is what it is. It is what I had to do to feel a little like me after cancer. It is not what I wanted no matter how many times before cancer I joked about perky boobs I would never to plastic surgery as want ever. Recon SUCKS but like anything it should be your choice. Do you have to have this no way. Flat and fabulous is just that but like recon not for everyone. I think the best thing is to talk to as many people as you can and listen to their experience and remember it is just that theirs you are different than them and will handle this your way. For now my size is comfortable, they feel comfortable and I am in a good spot. When I am dressed that is don't get me started on the scars, OY this post is long enough. Did anyone make it to the end?

I am 30 years old diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to bones, liver, ovaries, &amp; lungs with the removal of both my ovaries after we found out it spread to them.

My hair has thinned out immensely this second time around and will I will continue this treatment unless it ceases to work to keep me stable. The first time I went through treatment I just shaved it all off and allowed it to grow back after I was done with IV chemo which it came back thicker and better. 

This leads to my ever growing concern of how to help my hair from thinning while on these medications? I will be getting married in the next year or two since we postponed due to the epidemic and for the safety of our families and my health. I want to try and grow as much as I can so I don’t have to wear a wig on my wedding day since my hot flashes are so unmanageable.

I’ve cut most sugars and sodas, started taking magnesium pills, and am prescribed oxybutynin to help with hot flashes. I am quite afraid that they will not be managed by the time of the wedding. This means using my real hair in the wedding so I’m not so hot, but if worst comes to worst I will use a wig so if anyone has any other tips for hot flashes it would be greatly appreciated and loved. 

I’ve heard a lot of my friends and family tell me just go bald it’ll be ok, but my hair has always been my safety blanket. I know it sounds vain but it’s the only thing that got me through my school years when I was bullied for my weight and looks. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I truly appreciate it.



TLDR: Need advice on how to help thinning hair grow if it be vitamins, products, treatments also if you know any other tips or tricks to help with hot flashes it would be greatly appreciated. I’m getting married after the epidemic and want to use my own hair but hot flashes and wearing a wig feel like I’m being roasted over an open fire."
Icooktoo,1599605620,"I mentioned the enmed as so many here had mentioned, to my doctor. Come to find out I apparently am stupid (chemo brain) and did not realize that I had a fully loaded arsenal, I just had to use the weapons properly. Apparently no anti nausea med will work after nausea has started. And there it is. The failure. I waited till nausea started hoping that this time I won't be nauseous (stupid). So I used my favorite Phenergan every 6 hours like the world was going to end if I missed a dose. So this time there was no nausea. Boy did I sleep! And that brings up another question. When do you stop taking the med? My face hurt from being crammed in a pillow so long. I was tired of being in bed.  I keep chemo records so I consulted those as to how the nausea progression happened in the past (pre-smart). I stopped taking the meds today. This is also the day I start taking the meds for IBS. I don't always have to take them and just happened to have them handy so tried them when lower abdominal pain started. I take on average two. One last night and one tonight. They work. I feel drained. I have one more infusion in two weeks. Then Chemo is over forever because there is no way I'm doing this again. There should be a better way by now. It's 2020 for Gods sake."

pastalovin_feminist,1599539133,"     I have been showing signs that match up with early signs of breast cancer. I’ve been so busy with moving, and then resuming college this fall that I didn’t notice the signs. On my 20th birthday (August 24th) I finally realized the marks on my breasts were spots, and that it might be time to pay attention. These spots combined with previous signs, and a history in the family made me see. 
    I called my mom, and I tried to reach my doctor. I attend college two hours away from my hometown- so we scheduled an emergency appointment for the following week on a Thursday. Unfortunately that Thursday the office closed early due to severe storms. After a lot of run around and calls, my doctor got me a referral for a hospital here in town. 
This Wednesday I go in for an ultrasound on my breasts. 
     I am terrified, and I don’t even know if this is the right place to post this. especially since it’s not confirmed and so many of you have it so so much worse. I don’t really know where else to go to, it’s not like they have a “might have breast cancer” Reddit community. (Sorry for the dark humor) 
   I’m not going to the appointment along, my long term partner is accompanying me. But I just...I am terrified. I don’t know what comes next- if it’s not breast cancer theres still definitely something going on. I don’t even know what to expect or to tell them. 

If this isn’t the right place for this I’m sorry. Thank you for reading my ramblings."
ihadagoodchildhood,1599536260,"My mom was diagnosed just a few weeks ago, and tomorrow the scary stuff begins. She is terrified and is calling and texting my siblings and I to say things she wants to in case she doesn't make it through surgery (this is from her own worry--no one put that thought in her head that I know of). I'm certain everything will be fine, but I am so sad that she is so scared. I'm so sad that she has to go through this. I'm not sure I'm a great source of comfort, because I'm sure she can sense my own worry and sadness through my attempt at calm. I love my mom so very much and she is the greatest example of true kindness. She is wonderfully accepting and understanding of people. She's done so much good in the world, and I hope some of that karma comes back to her now, and provides the comfort she needs.

2MuchWineTonight,1599480431,"Hi everyone!! I'm 41 and currently on the fun pill called Tamoxifen. While I love my hot flashes and all that good stuff (Haa.... Haha...)... I need some input from you all!  

I was wondering if any of you had your periods stop or do weird stuff while on Tamoxifen? I've been on it for about two months and this is my second period cycle and it's, well, weird. My previous cycles were normal. Averaged 28-30 day cycle.  First day spotting/light flow, then full flow for 2 to 3 days then by day 5 it's done.  Now I'm on day 31, have had light spotting for a day or two. I feel like my period is about to start but it's just not here.  I'm not pregnant. That I know for sure. 

My oncologist said that I could have my periods stop completely due to Tamoxifen. He said anything is possible. Just wanted to know your experiences with it.

Thanks!"

Short version:

July 14-out of nowhere large swollen mass sub areola

July 17- OB / GYN apt, refer for diagnostic mammogram

July 21 - mammogram, calcifications noted bilateral,  irregularity noted; left breast, go down the hall for sonogram; suspicious lump with increased blood flow left breast. Radiologist recommends MRI with possible bilateral biopsy.

jump through insurance hoops.

August 11 - MRI with contrast . Focal area with increased inflow and outflow, 2.3cm at widest point. Enhancement of prominent lymph node, left.  Hollow tube biopsy recommended.

August 19 - Needle biopsy, core, left breast.

Now this is where I first jumped the gun.

August 26 - SP biopsy appt. scheduled.

August 24 - Biopsy results post to patient portal. ""malignant neoplasm of left nipple and areola"".

August 26 - Infiltrating Ductal Adenocarcinoma. Level 3 cell arrangement.

Go with Plan A -- lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy ; radiation, chemotherapy or both depending.........

We can do surgery on Tuesday or Thursday next week. What's you choice?  ""Ummmm, Thursday because I have class on Tuesday."" I have six classroom hours and 480 field hours left to do. Come hell or high water I will still be ""walking"" for that master's degree come December.  

This is when all the thoughts start.....I knew from the minute they sent me to sonogram this wasn't going to be good.  I'd been silent to this point; only husband knew.  Informed boss; asked her to respect privacy...so far so good.  

September 3 -- Lumpectomy and SN biopsy. My patience is wearing thin and I am terrified. 

I keep telling myself --- don't look at the patient portal; but I've still logged in at least five times today knowing today is Sunday and tomorrow is a holiday.  I just need to know.  I've searched every available segment of the online records; and the answers are not there -- only the bare minimum.  Struggling to know what is gut feeling (90% sure it is bad) or just my general anxiety.   

There are just so many thoughts that I am sure everyone goes through. Why me? I wasn't planning on this. I really probably have to deal with the rest of my life.  I might die a lot sooner than I was planning.  Oh man, please don't expect me to be an outspoken advocate. I don't want this to define me, but at this point it is. I am typically private, quiet, and reserved.  I am a loner. Only a few close friends, but I don't want to fight this alone and I can't ask them to bear my burden.

 I just want to know, even in broad terms, what is going to happen over the next year.  What's positive, what's negative, metastasized.  

Preparing for the worst, hoping for the best.  

Thanks for listening, Much Love

I’ve been experiencing waves of pain in my upper back for a few weeks now. I brought it up with my oncologist and she didn’t seem concerned and told me to monitor and we will discuss again at my next appointment, but did mention that bone mets is something they would look for if it continues. I’ve talked to my physio therapist and she has reassured me that the oncologist have their check boxes of questions and if they don’t seem concerned I’m likely not presenting the necessary symptoms. I am going to bring it up again on Tuesday but I am just curious to hear what the beginning stages of bone pain actually felt like, so that I can gauge how hard I may need to advocate for myself, if at all. 

For context I’m 31F, diagnosed with triple negative invasive Ductal carcinoma and inflammatory breast cancer. I did 4 rounds AC, 12 Paclitaxel, bilateral mastectomy and bilateral node dissection. There was residual cancer left over (not a whole lot though, from a 10-12cm tumour), and one positive lymph node out of 5 taken. I did 25 rounds of radiation and am now on Xeloda. My tumour was incredibly aggressive and fast growing (quadrupled in size in about 6-8 weeks).

Delicious-Lime-1,1599237516,"Hello,  

I recently noticed a dimple/indentation on one of my breasts a couple of months ago (lower part of breast, below nipple). I actually think it had been there for quite a while longer, but I hadn't realized it was actually a dimple at the time. 

I am 32, so my doctor thought it would be best to start with an ultrasound. A couple of fibroadenomas plus a cyst were found in the ultrasound, but none of them anywhere near the area of the dimple. My doctor then referred me for a mammogram at a hospital breast clinic. The hospital ended up doing multiple mammogram shots and a very thorough ultrasound. The radiologist looked at everything on the spot and also came in and did some of the ultrasound scanning herself. The radiologist said she didn't see anything concerning but would review everything and then see if an MRI might be required. Now she has reviewed the images again and said that she'd like to do a follow up ultrasound in six months, but that she doesn't think an MRI is necessary at this point unless something changes. She said she also consulted another colleague for additional input.  

While I am extremely relieved that she is not concerned and that the images didn't show anything alarming, the source or cause of the dimple still has not been revealed. How worried should I be about this? How likely could it be that a dimple is caused by a malignant growth that isn't visible on either mammogram or ultrasound? I know that mammograms aren't great for dense breasts... Is it worth pushing for an MRI at this point? I also know that MRIs can have a higher incidence of false positives, which is certainly also worth considering if that is worthwhile to go through.  

Any advice?"

How? I'm 36 so I know this is pathetic but I haven't set up a new gyno or PCP since I moved here a couple years ago.  Who do I call first? Do I have to go to my PCP to get a referral or what?? I'm panicking and can't think straight. 

Since the symptoms are manifesting in a skin condition maybe I can start with a dermatologist but Im afraid they'll blow me off and might not believe that this has been going on for a while so i know it's not bug bites.  It does look like bug bites but the persistence and spreading proves it's not. 

I was going to call my insurance to get a recommendation but also don't know where my insurance card is or how to find out my information since the site keeps asking for my plan number. I don't even know if I'm on the right site. There are so many Bluecross sub companies I have no idea who to ask or call.

Little_Earth59,1599180569,"Hello everyone, 

I am a 22 year old female and my breast pain started a month ago. about a month or two ago I started to feel breast pain (I would say to a point that when I touch my breast slightly it hurts) and I would feel the bad pain all the time and feel a heaviness in my breast while I walk or sleep or raise my arm or even when I’m sitting.... the pain also radiates to my armpit. The pain is only in my right breast. I’ve checked my armpit for swollen lymph nodes but I have found nothing. I have also checked my breast in multiple positions (sleeping / standing up) and I have found no lumps..... but my breast feels firmer. I made my mom (who is a retired gynecologist) to check my breast and she also found nothing. I also have 0 discharge or 0 color or size change. 

But I am still very concerned as the pain is a lot and my nipple has been super sensitive and my whole right breast throbs in pain and is firmer. I have decided to make an appointment with a breast doctor tomorrow to get a ultrasound and MRI and to figure this out. 

I wanted to write this post to hear advice / or any guidance during this time. Cancer has been in my family for the longest time, although not breast cancer but my family has history with lung, ovarian and kidney cancer. I will be very happy to hear from you guys. 

Thank you."
racharlotte,1599180149,"Hi everyone. My mum had BC 12+ years ago, and was all clear until last year. Scans she was having from a hysterectomy/hernia removal that picked up on cancer cells from the appendix showed a growth in her lung. Due to the size, they thought it was lung cancer and removed it successfully via surgery. We only found out afterwards that it was secondary breast cancer.

My parents didn’t really tell me a great deal at the time, and nothing more has been said since. I don’t want to bring it up with them as I’ll only upset them.

I’m still struggling to process the diagnosis to be honest. Is secondary breast cancer really terminal like people say? She has always said she doesn’t want to go through chemo again so the only treatment she has had is the lung surgery. Would chemo have been offered as well to help if the cancer has spread elsewhere too that she has refused? Is it now just a waiting game of hoping and praying that scans don’t show the BC to appear anywhere else? I’m just hoping that she hasn’t ‘given up’ by potentially refusing chemo for this and rather that the surgery was all the treatment that was needed. Although if because it has spread from the breast means that it is automatically incurable, then that doesn’t really fit... Thank you."

Because of her weakened immune system she can't really go outside, where everything she loved doing is. Losing her hair had a huge impact on her confidence. Although there were some yoga classes for cancer patients at the hospital, she rejected them all saying she didn't want to be surrounded where everything would remind her of ""cancer,"" and that having to wear a mask doing yoga would be suffocating.

Right now, all she does everyday is lie in bed, either sleeping, staring outside or thinking about things that  let her deeper into her anxiety and depression. Thankfully, I flew home from college for the next semester with online classes, so she wouldn't be home alone, as on weekdays my younger brother and father have school and work. I talk to her, listen to her, help with meals and chores, and try to even let her in on some of the projects and assignments I'm working on, but I feel like she has just... disconnected. She says she knows that she should find something to do that'll last a whole day to take her mind off of her thoughts, that she wants to try and live like her ""normal"" life, but she literally doesn't know what she can do. I tried borrowing some books  or puzzles and suggested doing crochet or going on walks outside once in a while, but she just smiles a bit and shakes her head. I feel I can't really force her to do things she doesn't want to do... She says that having me around already makes her feel so much better, but it saddens me to see her living literally just to get by another day, constantly plagued by anxiety and depression. 

I wish I could do something more. But again, I don't know if more would be better. My mom would tell me often times a day that she feels like a burden. That she gets anxious and nauseous when she thinks or sees my dad because she's giving him too much stress. She doesn't want me to take care of her so much or else she'll be too reliant on me. These words give me mixed emotions-- but I tell her that she is not a burden, and we take care of her because we love her. And I have, still and always will love her with all my heart. 

I tell her that this will get better, and we will get through this together, and I am here for her. I will be her beacon of positivity in life as she had always been for me. But in the back of my mind I also have my own doubts. Will this (emotional-wise) get better? Do I have the right to say these things when I'm not the one going through this? Am I doing enough? Too much? Too little? Is there even a ""just right?""

I'm sorry that this is so long and just a huge ramble, and if whoever made it here I really appreciate it and thank you for hearing me out. I think I'd like to just hear some thoughts or advice on facing the emotional challenges of this ""journey,"" or just anything about it, for both me and my mother. 
Thanks. I wish everyone out here the very best."

I want to know if anyone can share any clinical studies on the LONG TERM effects of Tamoxifen on younger premenopausal women. Since this drug is prescribed for 5-10 years after treatment and I will hopefully be alive for another 50-60 years, I find it interesting that I can't find any long term follow ups on younger Tamoxifen users. I want to know what Tamoxifen might do for decades after treatment, since the drug does have some worrisome short term side effects, including other cancers. Has anyone found anything? All I have found are shorter term studies on endometrial cancers and ovarian cyst leading to ovarian cancer. I'm less worried about the short term side effects and am focusing on living a long, healthy life. I don't want to be a statistic if this hasn't been thoroughly studied long-term, especially in younger women who may have decades ahead of them to worry about.

Just some background information: My mom studies side effects of pharmaceuticals for Bayer and also found it strange that there are no long term studies on Tamoxifen, that either of us can find. I am in the US. Maybe there are other studies from other countries I cannot find?"
daisysneal,1598976875,"Hope it’s okay to post this here! 

This is for a PhD study which has evidenced age bias in the treatment recommendations made by clinicians for older women with breast cancer. As patients/ survivors/ family members your input would be invaluable and greatly appreciated around possible interventions/ training programmes to help reduce this variation. Some possible ideas include introducing age bias awareness training for clinicians and clinicians having to input patients’ cancer details into an algorithm which generates the optimal treatment (so that their personal age stereotypes cannot be influential). 

Please reach out to me if you have any thoughts or ideas re. what will work, what won’t, and your experiences as to whether you felt treated differently as a result of your age.

mrsj123,1598944917,"I have a distant cousin,  I'll call her ""Summer"" she was diagnosed with bc in early 2015. She's about 15 yrs older. She did not take chemo or radiation. Hers was genetic through her mom (not my relative). She had her breast removed then got big fake boobs. She just has to take a pill for a few years. She also had a high school kid.

I was diagnosed mid 2015 at 29. mine is not genetic. I was originally misdiagnosed for a few months, in fact I had to fight and argue to get a biospy! She reached out to me, which was nice I guess. I honestly don't really know her never met her. Well she talked about how shes ""cheating"" (her words) she got out doing the hard stuff (chemo and radiation) and how she gets to keep her hair, even joked about her getting big fake boobs and how perfect they were and how she always wanted a boob job. All while my dr insisted I needed chemo, radiation, and a lumpectomy...she knew this. Then dr lost my paperwork and chemo had to be delayed for a month; I was so frustrated bc they said its was aggressive and so much had went wrong. It's a lot to take in while having to take care of 2 kids under 5yrs old. As soon I started the chemo she just disappeared. 

Fast forward 2020: she's doing well from what I've seen on fb as well as her new boobs.I've since had have a hysterectomy and extreme dental work done (some of my teeth broke from chemo). My hair is long once more. Sucks I'm in menopause in my mid 30s. My boobs are now uneven as hell- like d and over dd very noticeable! 

Summer gets on fb every October since 2015 to share her survivor story. Talking about how hard and traumatic her journey was and no one gets it with lots of pink ribbons and hashtags and shit. Talking about I'm there for those who have bc. Now I'm not doubting it  was not traumatic being told you have cancer. I'm also sure she was sore from her boob job. What aggravates me is that she literally sat there in 2015 joking and bragging that she didn't have to do the hard stuff and gets fake boobs. Whereas, I did do the hard stuff, hurt for days, puked, lost hair, developed a 9.5cm blood clot in my neck from the port, burns from radiation among other stuff; while rasing 2 small kids who didn't know what hell was going on. I had no help other than my husband. I get this is a serious disease and no cure, you just hope everything works. I also get not all cancer patients get the same treatment. I also understand we're a fighters and I mean no disrespect to others, who were spared the harsh chemo and all. I know I probably sound jealous or something but it really pisses me off. She acts like she had it so rough and hard and all, like she deserves a fucking medal for something women accomplish everyday. She has made me hate October and anything pink ribbon related. She literally posts daily in Oct about how badass she is with those damn ribbons. Last year I muted her so I wouldn't have to see it and saw her out at a cancer event and there she was giving an interview (with a group of ppl wear shirts that said team ""summer"" )talking about how she struggled from the terrible effects of bc and how difficult her life was bc of cancer but she's a fighter and beat cancer and won and people can contact her so she can help them. I wanted to say out loud for her to hear "" like how you were there for me, and you'd know exactly what it's like having your hair fall out in clumps while puking your guts up, and burns on your boobs- oh right you never had to do any of that bc as you said you cheated"" but I'm better than that. Maybe I'm just bitter bc she didn't get to have my horrible experience (which I wouldn't wish on anyone) then she could see how hurtful and disrespectful her bragging and laughing about getting out of chemo and radiation with her knowing what I was going through. I was already stressed from dr fuck ups then told how sick I'd be from chemo and she's pulling that shit! Maybe then she'd see why I have a problem with her and her posts. I wish I would have said something then but I had too much going on to deal with it. I'm thinking of unfriending her but if I do I'd never hear the end of it. I dont want to talk it out with her bc I seriously doubt she'll see my point. I guess I'll just keep muting her."

Enve4321,1598775101,"This is a throw away account because I would be too ashamed if someone I knew saw this. 

I have the worst bad secret. No one knows, family or friend. I have locally advanced breast cancer, not diagnosed, but it's obvious since my left breast is no longer a breast, it's ulcerating and fungating and it bleeds occasionally and has lately a foul smell.

I never thought denial could be so paralyzing, but I just stopped looking in the mirror when showering and easily did not think about what was happening to my breast. I honestly cannot report about progression since I just didn't look. When the ulcers developed and small cauliflower tumors on the skin, I bought some bandages and I've been secretly dressing the wounds by myself in the bathroom. The worst the area got, the more I got paralyzed, this time, the shame of it, how did I let it go so bad. I imagine the nurse gagging or the doctor accusing why did you wait so long. Do doctors get angry and accusatory in front of patients? Or the horror of my family if they find out, they will be so so furious at me. I don't think they could forgive me.

The thing is, I know I am so so so stupid. The more I wait, the more the shame grows. I don't even have the excuse of being uneducated or lacking money or lack of access to hospitals. 

 A month ago, my left arm swelled up to the fingers. My family was concerned but I've been inventing reasons. But yeah, I know I've reached the point that this bad secret is going to explode in my face.  Sometimes I think it'd be better to kill myself rather than the shame of people discovering my secret.

I have a strong family history of breast cancer so I decided when I was 35 to get genetic testing. I found out that I hold the BRCA2 mutation and was never informed by anyone that I would no longer be able to get life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance because of this pre-existing condition. Insurance carriers are allowed to discriminate and the federal GINA law does not provide protections against this. It has come to my attention that Florida is the first state pioneering these protections. I have included the link from facing our risk of cancer and powered (FORCE) which details in layman's terms the legislation.

veedey,1598646057,"I'm a 25 year old male. One year ago a red bump, the same as a small bug bite, showed up on the left side of my chest. Persistent and not going away. Strange. Few months later I had a biopsy and it showed benign inflammation, but my dermatologist has no idea what it is. It did not go away on its own, so we tried topical steroids which did nothing, and then a steroid injection which somewhat flattened the bump, but it's still there. It's not growing above or below the skin. It's just...there. It slightly hurts every once in a while, sometimes because I poke the s\*\*\* out of it making sure it's not growing. My doctor wants to wait a few more months to see how it progresses, and then try injecting it again with a steroid. After that, another biopsy if needed. 

Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Are benign inconclusive bumps like this at all common? And is there a chance that something like this could become malignant over time? The internet is the worst place to look for answers. The only piece of information I've been able to find about chest bumps that ""resemble bug bites"" is inflammatory breast cancer, which I know is already super rare in women, and even more so in men.

ch33s3brgr,1598637939,"Important reminder to take notes or ask to record meetings with medical professionals. Right now, you won’t always have the ability to bring someone with you into the room to help advocate for you. So it’s important to have notes to refer back to after your head is swimming. Also, don’t hold back questions until it’s “more convenient” for the doctors. Ask often, ask everything, ask for clarification. My living example of why this is important: my wife went through chemo and surgery for Stage 3 triple negative- nodes and breast tissue removed. During the follow up after surgery, the doctor said to her “there was still two millimeters of cancerous tissue left.”
My wife thought that meant there was still a cancerous tumor two millimeters big inside her. She wanted to ask “why can’t we get that out?” But she held back her question for a combination of reasons that were all fear based. She lived with this feeling of still having a tumor after surgery for three weeks of recovery. On a phone call with the oncologist last night, she gathered the courage to ask if radiation will help the tumor, and the oncologist was taken aback. She explained that the surgeon meant the tissue HE HAD REMOVED showed only two mm left of cancerous tissue, down from the 10 centimeter tumor she started with.

As part of getting this sub in to this century, I'm wanting to put together a list of commonly used terms when dealing with cancer.

Can be diagnosis codes (I was grade 2, stage 3C DCIS, ER+, PR+/-, HER2- and that's a LOT to know up front....but I know others might use different terms for some of the terms).

johair36,1598520903,Hello all..38 diagnosed stage 2 idc 2 weeks ago   ..I went in yesterday and I'm told they have found 3 more tumors in my breast .I'm so scared.they also think it's in lymph nodes and I had to have a biopsy.im having a mastectomy in 2 weeks....anyone had similar ?xxx
StTuRu,1598520654,"Diagnosed via MRI guided biopsy. I was on high risk screening because of ADH and a phyllodes tumor. Finished breastfeeding 6 months ago. Was about to try for a second kid. Mammogram didn’t spot it, MRI did. I’m 36.

I didn’t realize they would want me to start hormone therapy so soon. The surgical oncologist said there’s no research on delaying hormone therapy to have another kid.

They’re setting me up with a fertility consult. But honestly, egg retrieval, storage, 2 years hormone therapy, 2 years waiting...IVF. That sounds like a lot and then risks of pregnancy in my 40s...

Anyone have a similar experience, or know about risks of postponing hormone therapy? Or surgical options that would mitigate or reduce that risk, at least temporarily?"
briiiiick,1598497052,"I’m a 20 year old girl and my mom was just diagnosed (literally this morning) with breast cancer. We’re still waiting on the results of the type of cancer from the initial breast tumour biopsy, but the sample taken from the lymph nodes was positive for cancerous cells so the doctors said it’s at least stage two due to the spread, with the possibility to be upped to stage three dependant on the upcoming diagnosis of the type of cancer.

I think it goes without saying that my world is absolutely shattered. But, I know that this time isn’t about me and I have to be there for my mom. 

So, for anyone living with breast cancer, has defeated it and is in remission, or has had a loved one battle it and can offer insight, my question is this: what are the best things that I can do to help my mom in this time? 

And I don’t just mean the logistical things like how I’ll now be doing all the grocery shopping due to covid and chemo, or taking on more responsibility at home or things like that. But what are some little things that make big changes throughout the course of treatment? I’m just at such a loss right now and I have no idea how to help.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I apologize in advance if this was incoherent or confusing, my brain seems to be in a permanent fog.

TLDR: any moms who are battling/battled breast cancer, what are the best things your children did to help your journey through treatment? Or, what do you wish they did?"
NattyBafterCancer,1598481319,"Hi lovely folks. Wanted to share my video with you all that I recently did on 5 things I quit buying... after my experience with breast cancer. I make it very clear that **NOT** having or using these items is **NOT the answer** to a person never developing breast cancer. I wish it were that easy honestly. But we all know cancer of any type is much more complicated that that. But I do want to share my ""why"" behind no longer buying these things, plus i save some money too....

***Would love to hear what you folks did away with after breast cancer?***

Again, these are not answers, but personal decisions. 

Open to feedback and hope you enjoy :)

I am quite desperate right now - I discovered a small lump in my right breast - Fast forwarding everything, It was a cancer stage 1, and I did a lumpectomy, and it was confirmed HERS2 +  and estrogen and progesterone receptors by the biopsy. 

The oncologist wanted me to start right away on KADCYLA (instead of the traditional Chemo) - My Insurance (AMBETTER in Florida) is denying the medication to me.

We had appealed 2 times - I'll still try one more time, but I am scared that they'll decline again. 

Does someone is taking Kadcyla without traditional chemo? I need a bright light!! - TIA!!"
AlfieHitchcock,1598381980,"This is for my mom, but anybody here have experience of Stage 4 MBC with bone mets then spreading to skin mets? 

I know it's a very specific scenario, I figured I'd try though. 

My mom's had a nasty looking ""rash"" right over one of her nodules since a few months after she started chemo. The nurses swore it was from the tape over the nearby port. I never bought that completely, having known tape rashes myself from hospitals and from my mom's prior cancer battle. And knowing they usually go away or lessen within days. This was not like that, it was new and different. 

Not a rash but a deep solid red patch. It would not go away even when she was given a month off chemo. Still we were told it's a tape rash. 

Recently she's been having break through pain on the spot. Now the doctor is rushing her in tomorrow. His quick reaction had me concern so I went online. The patch she has really looks like skin metastasis. 

So can anyone tell me what should we expect next? (She's 36 months into this stage 4 diagnosis so I'm especially antsy.)"
freaknastyxphd,1598378861,"just a fyi,

our radiologist insisted that we stop kadcya during radiation so much so that she called the oncologist several times.  at first the oncologist didnt want to stop, but i guess there was a conference recently that addressed issues with these two treatments simultaneously, and he just called her today to let her know that she shouldnt return to the infusion center until after radiation."

katto,1598373811,"Yay!! This feels so surreal. The whole thing. But, as of now, I am officially cancer-free! I have 10 years of Tamoxifen ahead of me, but that's ok. This was quite the whirlwind!

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Stage 2 (er/pr+, her2-, grade 2, oncotype 12). I was very lucky to have found that little bean-like lump in January. Got my surgery right at the height of Covid where we live, so I feel very lucky to get the operation when I did. Clean margins, no nodes involved. Oncotype DX came back at 12, so no need for chemo (whoohooo! Got to keep my purple hair and not be sick all the time). Got bad post-op problems with seromas, oedema, liquid hematoma, but it all got resolved with time. Started Tamoxifen almost 3 months ago (bad night sweat and hot flashes). Just finished 16 rounds of radiation, whoohoo!

Cancer-free baby!!!

Good luck pink sister warriors!"
mayonnaisemonarchy,1598370736,"I posted this in the Breastcancer.org forums, but haven't gotten any bites so I thought I would try here.

I'm currently doing chemo for Stage 1b (but close to 2a?) IDC, with spread to one lymph node and lymph channel invasion on my right side. Tumor was around 1cm, had it removed during a lumpectomy in May prior to getting genetics results and finding I have the ATM mutation.

Soo, fast forward to now: I'm moving ahead with a BMX and recon in November. I finish chemo in October. I met with my PS last week and the plan is thus: BMX then expanders placed over the muscle in the same surgery. I'm a small person, so I'm not going larger with my breasts (size 32 C) but will need to size up a little because my breasts are tuberous and need to be expanded at the poles (underneath) in order to accompany the implant and alloderm down the line. So I'll have the expanders all through radiation and won't have my exchange until six months or so after, meaning no implants until this time next year. I can live with this.

But, I know there are complications to operating on radiated skin and I'm so worried about getting an infection and losing the expander prior to that. My PS said worst case scenario I go flat until I'm done having kids and then can do flap. I'm only 29 and just had my eggs froze, so I want to have a few years of hormone blockers under my belt before I try and get pregnant. That being said, I'd love to hear any success stories of women who went through radiation with your expanders and were able to get your implants placed successfully. Do you think there was anything you did to contribute to a positive experience? Staying clean with extra showers? PT? I'll take any advice I can get."
pretendimabubble,1598312663,"I guess I just need to vent.   I had IDC stage one diagnosis in June, surgery in July, and was supposed to start radiation last week.  I can't figure out how to schedule radiation - where my 4 year old can't enter the building for good reason, of course - covid- and my only support system (elderly parents) live an hour away.   I can't ask them to drive two hours everyday to watch my daughter for an hour.   Daughter could go stay with my parents for a few days but she'd miss the last week or so of daycare program, which maybe isn't a big deal, but I'd feel bad.   I could schedule radiation while she's at daycare but I am supposed to be starting grad school next week and orientation is really long.   If I put radiation off longer, then at that time daughter is going to only be at kindergarten two days a week!   I can't get help from co-parent because he's being investigated by CPS.  I just don't know how I am supposed to figure out the logistics.  

Speaking of figuring it out, I have had a sinus infection all month and my head feels as if it is full of rocks.    You know what else?  I have been spraypainting the toilet with diarrhea for almost two weeks.   I think it's because I had to go off bupropion (mild depression/anxiety) which worked really well for me and switch to citalopram.   Ny gut feels rather sure about this since it's an SSRI and serotonin regulates digestion and the diarrhea started the same day I started citalopram.    So i have been feeling weak and dumb and I spend so much time on, getting to, and cleaning the toilet that I can't concentrate on the scheduling stuff.  

Oh yeah I have a colonoscopy on Friday that I keep forgetting about.   I am lucky to have had genetic testing for breast cancer with the good news of no BRCA, etc, but random mutation linked to colon cancer.  Grateful to know, get screened, but it feels like everything is happening within a two week period here.  

After my early-July surgery, while in the recovery room, the surgeon said the CT scan done when they were locating the sentinal node showed a lung nodule and a liver lesion but we'd talk about that at the follow-up in a week.   I was dozing off then and for the rest of the day, so I thought the lung and liver thing were a bad post-anesthesia dream.   He didn't mention it at the follow-up and my PCP didn't mention it.   I continued to believe it was a dream until today when I got a call from the surgeon's office.

""I'm calling about scheduling the CT scan Dr. K ordered.""

""Uhh, I don't know what you mean.""

""Dr K ordered CT scans.  I'm behind in scheduling.""

""Uhh... I don't...""

""You have a lesion on your liver and nodule on your lung - ring a bell?""

""Oh, I thought that was a dream or hallucination.""   Shit.

""Your CT scan is on 9/2 at 2:00 and you need to prepare by...""

9/2 is right in the middle of that grad school orientation week.   Kindergarten registration is on another day during orientation and they are not flexible with the schedule.   Grandma could take kid to that, but that makes me sad to miss it.  

I know I am very lucky with my breast cancer diagnosis.   I know most lesions and nodules found on CT scans are benign.  I really can't complain.  I am lucky that I can get all these tests.   I am lucky to be on the doorstep of grad school.   I can even drop down to part-time and finish a year later than planned.  I just  haven't been able to figure out how to proceed and deal with some other life issues related to custody and co-parent.  I think doing part-time grad school is the ""be gentle with yourself"" good answer.   But I might not be gentle with myself if it takes an extra year to get where I am going.   While my prognosis is good, going through this makes me want to fart around less, and I'd rather be 46 than 47 when I am applying to entry-level jobs after graduation.  On the other hand trying to go full speed ahead might result in failure.

I just don't know how to make these appointments, decisions, make it to all the parent stuff and proceed with school during the uncertainty of this time for me personally and the uncertainty faced by almost all parents about how this school year is going to go down.  I am also dreading finishing the radiation and starting tamoxifen, so I am not very motivated to get on track with radiation.  All this needs to be planned and decided while I am using a great deal of consciousness simply trying to not poop my pants.

If you are still reading, I thank you for taking the time to do so and hope you are having a less frustrating day!

PS Sorry for any typos, another thing I need to vent about is that I can't read very well right now and I am frustrated because my insurance won't cover an eye exam until March.  Ha.  Another reason to put off grad school?"
maurakd,1598294694,"Hello, I finished 21 rounds of radiation last week and am starting tamoxifen today. Can I hear some stories about side effects? I know we are all different, but I am feeling very nervous. More nervous about this than I was the radiation and lumpectomy.

CharmingWarlord,1598286933,"Hello, I was diagnosed about a year ago with Triple-negative breast cancer. I went through chemo, surgery, and radiation and now I'm doing a clinical trial for a triple-negative vaccine. 

I'm going to the University of Chicago for the trial. At first, I had contacted the Mayo Clinic about it and they were great, but it's much further from where I live. I just finished my first round of chemo pills. I'm on a regiment of 2 cyclophosphamide pills (chemo pill) a day for 7 days, then 7 days off, 7 days on, 7 days off, then I go to Chicago for the vaccine. This is a 7-year commitment, and I'm getting the vaccine (or placebo) every month for the first 6 months. On the day of the shot, I'll also get a shot of a steroid and some white blood cell builder (like Neulasta, but not Neulasta). The chemo pill is only needed for the first 3 vaccine shots. I will come back after the first 6 shots every six months for a booster for the next 2.5 years. After that, I come back every 6 months for a checkup until we hit the 7-year mark and it's over. I figure an extra set of medical eyes keeping an eye on me can't hurt.

To start the trial, I had to give them 17 vials of blood! That was crazy. 

As much as I want this cancer journey to be over, I think the clinical trial is my best bet for not getting the cancer back. I have a 2 in 3 chance of getting the real thing. This trial is in stage 2. Stage 3 starts in about a year and they will open it up to a lot more participants. After that, they go for FDA approval. 

For the cost, my insurance company picked up the tab for the initial appointment and blood draw. I may have other labs that my insurance will be charged for. Everything in the trial is paid for by a grant from the Department of Defense. 

Anyway, I'm wondering if any of you may be doing the same trial or a similar trial, or if you're interested in information on this trial. You have to have triple-negative and that has to meet certain criteria. You have to have finished treatment or surgery at least 2 months before you start and within a year, so there's a window there."

Original_Revenue_778,1598172350,"So, I have always told myself that I am health anxious because I really am.

I am scared that one time, after checking myself up, I've feel something is off or whatsoever.

This all started when I experienced severe PMS symptoms ten days prior to my menstruation. I experienced breasts soreness, but it is gone after my menstruation.

Of course, during those times, I have googled everything. First, I thought I was pregnant even if I am a virgin. Second, breast cancer.

Now that I am cleared on pregnancy, I cannot stop on thinking about breast cancer. 

I always have an uneven breasts. I don't mind it before, but now I do. It scares me because my left breast is bigger than the other even if it has always been like that.

I always have inverted nipples. Both of my nubs are. But whenever I am cold, they would still be erected. That don't bother me before, but now, it does.

I am constsntly checking myself for any ither symptoms. Feeling myself up every fucking hour just to make sure that I don't have any lumps- I don't have, but I still look for it anyway.

It is like, my mind is automatically looking for symptoms because I am afraid that I might have missed one or maybe, I would see it when it is already a big trouble.

Though, I really don't have any symptoms to worry about. 

I always have stretch marks on my breasts because I usually experience gaining and losing weight. Also with uneven breasts and inverted nipples- I always have those since the beginning.

I don't have any lumps, nipple discharge, swollen lymph nodes, or pittied skin like an orange. I don't have those, but I am constantly worrying that one time, I might actually have one of those.

Just before typing this rant out, I just checked my breasts again for any lump, but none- I found none.

But still, I am worried. And probably, after a few minutes of posting this, I'll check myself again.

And it is so damn exhausting."

However, we still share a washing machine and eat the same food (but I make sure to wash my own utensils).  So I guess my question is - since I am my mother's only caregiver, should I stop seeing my boyfriend completely? I've heard stories about how tough it is to quarantine while living in the same household. My mom's chemo is scheduled to last for the remainder of this year and then she might have surgery and additional treatment, so if I want to be safe, there is a possibility that I won't be able to see my boyfriend for maybe close to a year.

Original_Revenue_778,1598133500,"I don't know if I am just health anxious or what, but having breast cancer is a worry that is eating my whole life already. I cannot enjoy things that I used to enjoy, and I just found myself sleeping more and more so I will stop on thinking about it.

I don't have any symptoms, but I am worried as hell.

I first got the idea that I may have breast cancer when I experienced extreme breasts soreness 10 days prior to my menstruation. I am sure that it is due to my menstruation because after I got it, the soreness is gone as well.

The problem is- I checked the internet and bumped into the worst possible case scenario: breast cancer.

Eversince then, I cannot stop myself from checking already. I always check my body for symptoms that I don't have, worrying that I may have just missed it the last time. 

It is freaking me out.

It does not help that I really have inverted nipples since I was a kid, but they still pop out whenever I am cold. It did not bother me before, but now, whenever I see that they are inverted, I will pinch them immediately just to see if they will still pop out.

It is making me so frustrated and so occupied with health worries. I don't know. I don't have any of the symptoms, but I went all way to read every possible article about BC, and assured myself that I don't have the symptoms, but I still cannot stop myself from worrying.

Within a day, I am checking myself in an average of 30-50 times. I will look for any symptoms, get stress over them and would decide to just sleep the day out. 

It does not help that we are in quarantine. I've got nothing else to do, but to stay at home the all day- nothing can distract me or anything. I will watch, but later on, I'll find myself checking my boobs again or looking at the forums online.

I don't know anymore what can ease my worries. I don't have any symptoms, and I know that myself. But hypochondria is eating me alive."

My title here is also the title of a podcast on Spotify. It is two women just chatting about their breast cancer journey. Their experiences, feelings, just their lives in general living with this stupid disease. 

I found it immensely comforting to listen to because it’s a patient perspective, it’s not Wikipedia defined, it’s not a dr who’s never been through it. 

I liked it in particular because these women are early 30s. Which was nice because so much research and anecdotes that are around are from women 50+.

latinuh96,1598033581,"I (23f) have been having chest pains for a while which, due to my weight loss, assumed was either gas from my diet or due to my sagging skin from the weight loss. 

Last night I felt the pain again. It worries me because it’s near my heart. I suddenly thought to do a self exam. One lump is the cause of my chest pain and I found another on the top of my breast/nipple. 

My mom felt them and confirmed my suspicions. I emailed my doctor and am waiting to confirm my appointment. 

Has anyone felt that symptom? I know cancer is different for everyone but I was trying to do some research and, so far, nothing about chest pain and lumps on the breast being mentioned together."
Icooktoo,1598022184,"Hey all,

I have noticed, even before the chemo started, that my skin has gotten very dry. So much so that the skin on my cheeks feels like sandpaper. I can see the dryness in my magnifying mirror!  I have used Loreal Revitalift for years. Religiously. And the eye cream. Love the eye cream applicator. But I am afraid, because the moisturizer hasn't done much, that all there is to like about the eye cream is the applicator. I am absolutely not knowledgable about new products since 1976. I graduated beauty school, went to work in a couple salons, hated it and got out of the biz. from 1977 til 2010 If I wore makeup at all, I could probably count the times on one hand. I haven't done much more than wash and moisturize till the last ten years or so. I also use a tinted moisturizer when I wear makeup, which has been twice since March! I am currently trying a vitamin C and E serum from Youn Beauty ( a holistic plastic surgeon I found on YouTube), and a moisturizer/ brightener from the same company. I have been using these products sporadically for about a week and a half. Immediately after use my skin feels baby bottom soft and it looks smoother in the magnifying mirror. Those two products are not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but if they keep my skin in good shape (I know I need to be more diligent about using it regularly) it will be worth the expense. 

Is anyone else having this experience? What product(s) have you found that works?"
curiousbunch,1597996156,"Hi there,

I dont know if i an in the right place to ask but might as well give it a try. Friend of mine got diagnosed last march. Right when everyone went into corona lockdown, it was hard seeing her since. 

She is a relatively new friend to me and therefor i was not always sure how to consolidate her. Kept sending messages to ask how she was doing but offcourse through the phone it is not easy to connect and see what is happening to someone.

Two weeks ago i did get to visit her and it was obvious that she is very though cookie that is stil holding it together (by the look of her one would not even think she was sick, just doing her thing), but she did say she has a very hard time dealing with treatment offcourse. Her chemo got delayed a couple of times and she was supposed to finish chemo end of August, have three weeks off, get the surgery, and then get radiation as well. I know she was really looking forward to those three weeks!

Now, as it turns out, her last chemo did not work properly and she is scheduled for surgery next wednesday. So now me and some other friends are trying to think of something that we can get her, or do for her, that could somehow make her feel better. 

But the more i think about it, the harder it gets to think of something. I mean, we can not visit her much, cant hug her without risking immune problems. 

So if there is anyone here who has an opinion, please let me know. Would you rather get a big stuffed animal, nice food/drink to chill with, music, books? I know she puzzels but she has a big unfinished stack, i dont wanna rush her with the puzzels! anhone have experience in needs of someone who is is her shoes? 

You are already awesome for reading all this, and any suggestion is kindly appreciated!"
Philosophy-Sharp,1597982054,"Hi there, I was diagnosed June 30th with IDC, just found out Stage 1. ER+ PR+, Her2-. If my oncotype comes back low, then it sounds like my treatment will be pretty straightforward and prognosis good.   
I feel incredibly lucky I found this early. 

I just turned 40 in March, then COVID, now cancer. Given my age, in Feb. I started fertility treatments to put embryos in ice if I can with my boyfriend, b/c insurance now covers it. Then that was on hold b/c of COVID. Then cancer diagnosis. In July, I restarted fertility treatments, and did retrieval same week as lumpectomy, but didn't have success. I'm now switching clinics to see if I have better luck after a bad experience, before starting radiation likely in a month (just had a lumpectomy last week). I hope to get in at least one round of egg retrieval if I can before radiation, not sure if I can do it after? 

I keep thinking about how depending on where you are at in your life stage (20s, midlife, post menopause) the BC experience and surrounding life concerns can be very different. I'm sure each of these groups feels like it's particularly hard for them at their life stage...but since I'm at the earlyish mid-point, with no children yet (b/c didn't meet my partner until I was 38), it feels particularly harsh. If I was 25-30, I feel like I would have time for treatment and kids, or if older, wouldn't have fertility as a concern. I know this is very generalized, but I've taken it pretty hard. 

Most of the google searching I've done to find a community/women in a similar boat are women my age or a little younger/older but with children already. Anyone out there in same boat -- no children, breast cancer, might want children in a few years, have words of wisdom? Or resources/links to groups? Thanks."

Top_Yam5054,1597974900,"Hi there, 

To start: I've already made a doctors appointment to get this checked out. As of right now, I'm not able to get into the doctor for several weeks, but because I'm so concerned, I've contacted my doctor to see if there's someone else she can refer me to so I can get in sooner. So I'm not using reddit to diagnose myself; just looking to see if anyone else has experienced something like this. 

I have very small breasts that tend to swell around my period. The right one has always been slightly larger. Probably two or three months ago, I noticed that it feels as though the bone under my right breast protrudes when my breasts swell around my period. It wasn't until my cycle this month, however, that I realized that it's only under my right breast that this happens. This abnormality is what has caused me concern and led me to wonder if there is some sort of mass under the bone. 

I have only noticed this when my breasts swell around my period, but as I've mentioned, I have very small breasts, and so I think it's possible that this protrusion could be happening all of the time, and it's just not as apparent to me without the swelling. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I also have a severe anxiety disorder and go therapy weekly for OCD focused on health fears, so I am trying my best to manage this fear as I wait for my appointment."

When my wife was diagnosed, we had a long conversation with our son about what was happening. We were very transparent and let him ask questions and didn't sugarcoat anything.

Recently he has had these terrible outbursts. He will get so upset and it takes forever to calm him down. My wife sleeps a lot during the day since chemo makes her tired, and these often happen while she is trying to sleep. 

He has been an absolute gem these past few weeks his mom has been sick, and I know it's a lot to take on for him so I try to be sympathetic and console him the best way that I can.

I was taking herceptin and Perjeta since my mastectomy but, as I am HER2+ and Er+ and did not have a PCR to the original chemo my oncologist has switched me to Kadcyla. 

I wasn’t having too many side effect with the H&amp;P combo and was reassured by the onc that Kadcyla is generally well tolerated. I had my first one on Monday and since then I have been really nauseous. It reminds me of early stage pregnancy and I haven’t been eating much at all the last few days (I thought my dry cracker days were behind me....). I’ve been given Valoid (Cyclizine) to take for nausea but it’s doing nothing and although I have some Ondansetron, which I found great in the past, it’s not recommended if you are also taking Tamoxifen. 

Would anyone have any other suggestions for alleviating the nausea and, if you also had it, roughly how long did it last?

kendustin,1597785477,"this years been a tough year. my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018. we was optimistic that she would beat it. we didn't think anything of it. but me and my mother told my sister to go to her chemotherapy. she went all the time. that's when she started to live with us. things started getting better. the doctor said the tumor was shrinking. my mother told my sister she should get surgery to have her breast removed. but my sister didn't wanna do that. so after my sister got the good news that her tumor went down and shrunk and things was getting better, she decided to go to Florida for a few weeks. here's the thing. my sister got breast cancer when she was in Florida. she had symptoms before her diagnoses. her breast and arm was getting swollen and my sister's boyfriend who was in another state told her to go seek help right away. but she never listens.

fast forward to the news about her lump going down. after she got the news. her arms and breast was returning to normal and wasn't swollen anymore. my sister went back to Florida. my mother told her that she should continue her chemo and don't go anywhere. my sister was the attention seeker type. use things to gain sympathy and attention. she knew we were all concerned that she was putting men over her health, my mother told her don't go and her exact words was ' its my life i do whatever i want if i die i die' my sister was in Florida seeing another man. her long time boyfriend knew but he let her explore because she was getting bored at home and he was working too much (he's a cop) her going to Florida was a mistake. her tumor started to grow again. her breast started to turn blackish. her arms were swollen. so as she came back and went back to chemo, the chemo wasn't working anymore. my sister started to lose her hair. the cancer was causing my sister to have a weird odor. her body and lungs would get filled with this weird smelling liquid and she would have to go in to the hospital to have the liquid drained from her body. we knew it wasn't her fault. the smell was coming from the liquid that was forming from the cancer and clogging her lungs and stuff.

then my sisters health went downhill. before this pandemic she started losing her hair. her body was getting swollen. her face was changing. then in June my sisters long time boyfriend put her in a hospice. that's where my sister passed away. my sister passed away in june 6. my stepfather passed away on june 8 from covid-19. right now i feel like its a shock. its a shock to everyone. at the begining i was crying alote but now i feel like i wasted out of tears and can't feel anything. what makes me feel better is keeping my mind off this and i do that by keeping myself busy. i continue attending my classes on zoom, i watch tv and just doing things like that. the only time it gets tough thats when i'm walking outside. walking around the places that my sister and stepfather use to be at. i start to get depressed and cry. at night is the hardest because my mind starts to think of my sister and stepfather. then i get this feeling of sorrow and despair. when i look at old photos i think to myself and try to figure out what went wrong and what could have been done differently. last night i was looking through my google photos and i found videos and photos of my sister and stepfather. i'm still in shock. i dont know how to accept it.

the worst part is seeing my mother. she lost her daughter and her husband. i could tell she's in pain but i don't know how to help her. i'm having difficulties coping with it myself. i saw my mother crying and she pretended like she wasn't. in the shower today she was crying. i could tell when i saw her eyes when she came out. to be honest i don't know how to even move on or accept it. i don't know how to be there for my other or anyone when i'm avoiding it by keeping myself busy. sometimes i find myself crying and expecting my sister and stepfather to pop out and say its all a joke. this makes me think of my own life and death and it makes me afraid. i believe that time doesn't heal anything. you learn to live with it. when christmas comes or thanksgiving or birthday, that's gonna be the hardest. how do i allow myself to heal and deal with it instead of ignoring it?"

Hi folks, I am a young breast cancer survivor. I was diagnosed at the age of 29. during my (continued) journey I realized that there were limited visuals for me to watch when I would do research, and when I did find videos the reality was, I couldn't always relate. Cancer sucks thoroughly at any age, but I was young and everything I found, the women or men were much older. Though I was still able to learn from what I did find, as a practicing psychotherapist I also understand the psychological power and in part what it does for emotional healing when you see the face of someone who looks like you, close to you or has more in common with you, such as age. This compelled me to eventually (once I started feeling better this year) to start my Youtube channel. This link is an important one. I tell you 5 important questions we ALL should be asking our oncologist after a diagnosis. As I mention, there are a MILLION and one questions  one could ask, but here are 5 you don't want to miss... I. hope it is helpful for someone in this group"

Anyways, I visited her a week or so ago, I managed to find a job closer to them after living away for 5 years, and will be moving provinces at the end of the month.

Successful_Run6467,1597639881,So I found a lump on my right breast about 3 weeks ago my GP sucks so I called my obgyn and scheduled an exam. Went the week before last she felt the lump and said she didnt think it is anything big bad or scarey however she wanted to make sure since I am over 30 so she ordered a mammogram and an ultrasound I did that this last week. I went into the appointment for those super scared ladies at my work and my mother in law made mammograms sound horrid it wasn't that bad got done with that went for my ultrasound the tech seemed to have troubles I am not sure though so she finished up. Told me to wait that she was going to bring a doctor in and said do not be alarmed um ya ok. So the doc comes in takes some images and finishes up. I sit up she says well it doesnt look like a cyst. I have something that looks like an open milk duct but at my age or something it shouldn't be like that. Um ok she says they could do a biopsy but that would leave scarring she recommended an mri. She didnt say it's not cancer and she didnt say it is. She also said that insurance might not cover it. So i had to have my actual obgyn order it and now I am waiting for the approval and I have all these thoughts in my head what if it is cancer and they want to see extent I cant stop stressing.

Vivid-One2535,1597638813,"So this morning after I got out of the shower, while examining my boobs as I typically do, I noticed a small red patch of skin on the lower part of my right breast. I exercise quite often and wear tight sports bras and have experienced skin rawness on my underboob section, but this patch was located a bit further up and not near the band area. 

The patch is about 1-2 cm wide, has small bumps, is raised and feels kind of bumpy, and is very itchy. For reference I am 20F, black, and 140 lbs/5'3 which puts me in a ""normal"" BMI. 

Of course after googling what this patch could possibly be, the front search page is filled with results mentioning Inflammatory Breast Cancer. I used to deal with things like eczema when I was much longer but have not experienced anything like that for over a decade, so these search results kind of made me start to worry. 

For now I am going to stay calm and monitor the area, and tomorrow morning I am going to make an appointment with my PCP. 

Should I be more concerned? What should I do? When I talk to my doctor should I insist they take any specific action? Should I see a specialist?

I'm hoping that some of you may give me some information on what your caregivers did that helped you or what you wish they did that could have helped you more. 

So far, I've started a log of appointments, doctors names, dates, outcomes, insurance info so we have it readily available. I've put together a list of questions that we should probably ask during appointments. I've started the process at my work of what i need to do to make sure that I can attend all appointments and take time off for whatever treatment may be necessary. Of course there is emotional support and whatever i can do at home/ease at her work while she is working. I've offered to make the needed phone calls to immediate family once we find out what the plan is so she doesn't have to deal with it.  Is there anything that your so's/caregivers did that you really appreciated or anything that you wish they did? Any supplies/stuff to look into that i can have at the ready for her.

Our world has been rocked and I know this is just the beginning. But I have a few questions to start.  Has anyone had experience with chemo during pregnancy? I know they say there are safe ones but I find it hard to believe they can be safe for the fetus.  Breastfeeding while on chemo? How long do they typically do chemo for? How long do they typically keep tissue expanders in for before reconstructing? Valves or tubes? Why not just put a temporary saline implant while waiting?

About 2 years before my breast cancer diagnosis, I started to have migraines with aura. I can remember each time they have happened because the aura always makes me think I’m going blind. Each time I have had one, it seems like it is related to some hormone change (decrease in breastfeeding, on period, pregnancy, delivery of baby). When I was diagnosed with BC, one of my first questions to my oncologist was “are we worried about brain mets because of the newer onset of migraines?”  She reassured me that it was most likely the hormone changes related to the cancer (it was probably a little more articulate than that, but that’s what I remember). The only other concerning symptom that may be nothing are floaters (I think these started before diagnosis). I did see an ophthalmologist, and everything was normal. In subsequent visits with the oncologist, I have asked about PETs and CTs and she said they don’t routinely do them unless there’s a concern or I request one, because otherwise you end up getting biopsies when you don’t actually need them. 

I guess my question is whether anyone else chose (or even their doctor chose) to have a brain MRI. And then why? 

I’m terrible at making these decisions on my own. I feel like I’m being dramatic about my symptoms 99% of the time. :) so thanks in advance for your experiences!!"

I'll find out Tuesday if I need the expander exchanged. It's cosmetic and totally not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.... but man alive I'm tired of this.

###I'm male 30 years old. One of my nipples started to hurt a couple days ago.

It tends to hurt from time to time, but never before for so long and so ""bad"" !-(it's really not that painful; a 2 on a scale of 1 to 10, but it's usually a 0.5 I would say)-!. My nipples have always been a little lumpy and soft, they only get rugged(?) when I'm cold or I pinch them, I have never liked that but from most angles they look completely normal.

So I'm a little worried about what I should do about this. I read on a reliable medical website that pain is not usually a sign of breast cancer, that you should look for red spots, visible small lumps or secretion, and of course, that breast cancer is very rare on males. **Should I go to a doctor or wait for if it gets worse?**

I scrolled fast through some posts of r/malebreastcancer (couldn't post there, seems like is a dead sub(?) 😕), and this response from u/OC-Dilly caught my attention:
&gt;Got the mammogram and ultrasound it’s not cancer just female breast tissue growing for some reason. They said is prob medication related except I don’t take anything that would do that.

He said in his post that there was a lot of pain and lumps on both nipples. **If is not cancer, why the pain? Is there a way to get rid of that tissue besides surgery?**

Thanks in advance."
2MuchWineTonight,1597583192,"Hello everyone,

I've posted here  before about my breast cancer. Quick recap, I was diagnosed with DCIS then upgraded to IDC stage 1b, 6mm in my left breast, ER/PR+, HER2-. Oncotype was a 3. Had a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery at the end of June. No chemo or radiation. Was told that I'd be on Tamoxifen for 5 years. Oh, and I'm 41.

I started Tamoxifen 3 weeks ago. I was wondering what types of symptoms you all had for those who are/were on this fun Tamoxifen. 

I have started to feel some joint pain. In my back (with 2 surgeries on my lower back I figured that's where it would hit first) and my jaw. I had initial fatigue but that has passed. I'm very emotional but I don't believe it's because of the medicine. 

Please share your experiences with this fun hormone suppression pill. Thank you!"
Endraa,1597554680,"Hi all,

It  randomly popped into my head to do a breast exam today so I started  feeling around while I was standing up. I have small breasts, so it's  easy to feel around. I felt a small little lump - smaller than a  jellybean. It does not feel rock hard, but like a grape almost? Feels  smooth. I started freaking out because that breast also has two brownish  skin moles that appeared some time this year I think (I can't remember  when I noticed them, but definitely some time this year or last year.)  The moles are small (2mm) and are just every so slightly raised  (visually look flat, but can feel a slight raise with fingers).

So then I looked up how to do a proper breast exam, and rechecked lying  down with arm behind my head. The strange thing is - when doing this  lying down, I couldn't feel the lump at all no matter how thoroughly I  feel for it.

At first I was freaking out and ready to make an appointment first thing Monday, but now that I've checked lying down, I have no idea if this is worth getting checked immediately or if I should wait until the virus dies down a bit more first."

Mordeline,1597546158,"So I've got breast cancer. Next week I go to see the surgeon. 

What will happen to me if I agree to a mastectomy and radiation but no chemo?

I can't even stand to think about doing chemo. That's the part of cancer ""treatment"" that's worse than the disease. Nausea, constipation/diarrhea, chemo-brain, hair loss - what the FUCK is the point of it? Plus since your immune system is damaged during the ""treatment"", you can pick up other nifty little ailments that could kill you too!

So I'm hoping that chemo won't be necessary. But since a lymph node is affected, it probably will be - or so I'm told.

The answer will still be NO."

We were told that lumpectomy+radiation+hormone therapy was the preferred therapy.  However, my mom is adamant and 100% sure that that she does not want to do hormone therapy.  We were told that if she did a unilateral mastectomy, that she does NOT need to take hormone therapy.  However, I have read the opposite, in which hormone therapy is indicated after unilateral mastectomy to prevent cancer on the opposite breast.  To me, it seems logical that if you take hormone therapy after lumpectomy, then you should need it after a unilateral mastectomy as well.She was also told that she does not needed a sentinel lymph node biopsy.   


1. I was wondering if any of ya'll could give some input in this situation, and whether you would do a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy.  
2.  2. If hormone therapy is indeed indicated for unilateral mastectomy, would it be advantageous to do a bilateral mastectomy, as my mother does not want to take hormone therapy?  

3. 3. Is a sentinel lymph node biopsy unnecessary? I would like to make sure, as it appears that it cannot be done after a mastectomy has been performed. 

Thank you all for any advice!"
ayLotte,1597523292,"Hi everybody!

I (32F) have a couple fibroadenomas since many years ago. They stay controled and I do regular scans because my mother had breast cancer.
I'm not pregnant and have never been.
Yesterday I discovered a pretty big new hard lump on my breast. It's around 2-3 cm and hurts a lot, specially when touched. 
It's kind of visible, the breast has changed it's shape because of It and skin is now red over it. 

From what I know this is probably an infection, not BC. But it's 2 days until I can call my doctor (closed until Monday) and this feels very big. I guess I'm looking for experiences + talking about this with somebody. Maybe reassurance that it's probably just a mastitis?

Thank you"

KnowerOfUnknowable,1597376564,"Hi all. My apology in advance if this is not the right sub for this question but I am not sure where else might be a better resource...

My wife (50-ish) and her sister (late 40-ish) are as close as any siblings humanly possible. They see each other everyday, talk all the time, sister in law come to our home to hang out with my wife any time she wants. Their friend groups are completely integrated. They are each other's best friends for life. My sister in law also has never been married and is still living with her parents.

She also just got her second cancer diagnosis this year. The first diagnosis came at the beginning of the year. Needless to say it was tough on everybody but we soldier passed chemo which finished a month ago. Yesterday when she gone back to the oncologist for a post chemo check up, they discovered cancer elsewhere. Long story short it is going to be, realistically, a death sentence. I think we might be lucky to have 12 months, but possibly much shorter.

My wife is putting on a brave face for her sister. I think it is also likely that the reality hasn't sunk in yet. I am devastated just thinking about how she is going to walk with her sister to the end. We have a very good relationship and I am going to be there 100%. I can be whatever she needs me to be.... but I also don't think that is sufficient. I think it is best to have some professional help starting right now to guide her and help her to wherever this is going to ends up in whatever schedule. 

My question is what kind of professionals should I be looking for? I am confused about the classification between therapist, counselor, psychologist and psychiatrist."

themostacceptable,1597296391,"I've been on it for just 47 days. At 39 days I started experiencing some pain in my lower abdomen. I spent most of yesterday in the ER because it got severe enough for me to get convinced by a friend who recently had it to convince me it was possibly appendicitis. Ultrasounds showed that my ovaries are covered in cysts. Some have ruptured, some haven't. My left ovary is absolutely huge because of the cysts. It's supposed to be 3cm and they told me they're concerned for torsion at 5cm. Mine is 8cm. They initially thought it was my right ovary because it's just bouncing around in there and was crossed over the front of my uterus. They think the pain is because the hemorrhagic cysts on my left ovary are filling quickly and also I may have experienced torsion but that it untied itself. The ER gyn is certain they're caused by tamoxifen as I have no history of cysts and my scans when I was diagnosed last September/October were clear. The pain is awful. Not 10/10, but certainly very uncomfortable and Tylenol doesn't alleviate it. If I'm sitting down, it can go up to a 5/10. If I'm walking, it can quickly jump to a 7 or 8. 
Next Tuesday I have a follow up with a gyn and Wednesday I have my next herceptin and perjeta infusion, so my oncology team is actually going to see me (for the first time in about two months I might add. Thanks pandemic). I did call them today to update them on the situation but they had no response yet. 
So I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I know no one knows for sure what my oncology team is going to do except them, but I'm just looking for people with similar issues."

I have 12 week old twins and am (mostly) exclusively pumping for them.

The woman who scheduled me made it sound like I’d be pretty sore for about 24 hours after and recommended hourly icing. I’m worried about the discomfort afterward and am afraid I won’t be able to pump for the day which would lead to engorgement/clogged ducts/supply dropping issues.

koalapants12345,1597180875,"So just a little background on me, I’m 26/F. Breast cancer does not run in my family. 
A few months ago I felt a hard lump on my left breast and decided to check it out at my universities clinic. 
At the time, the doctor physically examined my breast and said it’s probably a mass, but she still provided me with a referral for a breast ultrasound. 

In March, I received my results, they wrote BIRADS 3 and Fibroadenoma? (With the question mark) and it said I must follow up within 6 months for another ultrasound. 

After reading on the internet (not the best source) exactly what it means and if it is dangerous, it said &lt;2% chance it might be cancer. 

Today, I went to my GP (because I need another referral for the ultrasound) as soon as he looked at my results he said ‘omg that’s dangerous make an appointment ASAP. And when I asked well can you please explain more into this, he responded with 3 is no cancer, 4 is cancer your in the dangerous zone’ and then rushed me out of his office... 
Which all it did was make me cry and feel super anxious now. 

So what I’m asking essentially is, those who have had test results of BIRADS3 or just have a knowledge of it, maybe you can provide me with some information. 

Because, my GP did not provide any sort of detail or any assurance of what exactly I’m facing.

Philo-Dens-Dom,1597166789,"Hi everyone. I have been lurking a bit in r/cancer, I made a post, I have commented here and there. I just found this community because someone in the comments there mentioned there was a sub for their cancer type, and I thought I'd try r/breastcancer in the search, and here I am. I thought I'd get more input from people with the same kind of cancer here, and I'm spinning right now. 

As the title says, I got the results of the latest MRI today. I've just finished 6 months of chemo. The tumour has only shrunk by a small amount (4mm). Obviously, I was told at the start of chemo that this would be my best shot, and that the medical team expected to see significant shrinking as a result.  From what I've been told,  and from what I've read, my chances of the bloody thing recurring are now much higher. And now I've become really afraid of metastases. 

I am about to have surgery, and was told that I would have radiotherapy. Today I learned that I might have to have more chemo, depending on the pathology of the bastard tumour. The internet talks about chemo in metastasis, and how that's more about maintenance than getting rid of the fucker, but is it usual to have additional chemo in this circumstance? Of course,  all the questions only occur to me after I'd left the doctor's office. 

And I'm really fucking angry about the uncertainty. Like, there's no advice that I can take to help prevent it coming back, or other cancers occurring (I also tested positive for the Chek2 gene mutation, which is commonly associated with progesterone positive tumours). No one can tell me how I will react to the drugs or the therapies, because it's all so individual. I hate that it's all up to chance, it feels so fucking fatalistic,  and I like to take control and be proactive about my life and health etc. I hate that triple negative tumours have fewer therapeutic options, making it more important to smash it with the first lot of chemo. I really hate that it didn't fucking work.

Has anyone else not had their triple negative tumour shrink after chemo. What are your stories? What questions should I be asking at my pre surgical appointment (this Friday)? How do you deal with the fear and uncertainty? How do you reassure your partner?  

At the moment,  I'm so fucking furious that no one can give me straight or definitive answers. I need something more to go on. 

Fuck cancer so damn hard."

I have other chronic illnesses so once all the normal tests(covid,flu,strep,mono) came back negative I was hoping it was one of them. But three weeks of swollen lymph nodes, two rounds of antibiotics and a round steroids later- I went to see my family doc. 

First she checked my lymph nodes. I have swollen ones all throughout my neck, under my left arm and in my groin area. She then asked when I last did a breast exam. Shamefully I told her it had been awhile. So she did on one me and as she was checking the left breast the pain was horrible. She also said ‘wow their everywhere’. 

I got blood and urine taken today, and a chest X-ray done. I peeped a look at the X-ray and there is definitely a mass there. I am waiting on a call to tell me when my mammogram is.

So much of me just wants to avoid looking, but I don’t know if it’s feasible. I need to be able to take care of myself and monitor healing progress and watch for signs of infection. 

Do I just bite the bullet and look? I hate how much cancer has changed me already. This is such bullshit! How do I get past this? So much of me is changing or being taken away. Who will I even be when this is over? Will I even know or like that person? 

I’m sorry for the whining. I just need to get it out."

jd929478,1596870408,"In the last 4 months my left breast started getting bigger and more lumpy. Important details:  I have had Mirena for the last year years, no family history of breast or ovarian cancer have not had a period in over 2 yrs due to IUD. I went for an annual OBGYN appointment (didn’t say anything about it as I know things fluctuate) and she also pointed it out... and sent me for an ultrasound of the left breast as she felt it was more lumpy and just wanted to be sure. When I went to get the ultrasound the tech asked me where the lump was I sort of directed her but I felt like she was in a hurry. The report came back normal. Since that point in time my left breast has continued to get larger (now a almost one cup size different from right... used to be almost symmetric!) also my boyfriend pointed out I suddenly have much more prominent veins on the left side as well which I really notice now too. Am I being dramatic or should I got back to OB and tell her I am still concerned despite the ultrasound being normal? I’ve had clear nipple discharge on the right side only when expressed but no other symptoms."
CBoneThrowaway,1596867621,"Hi all. So a couple of weeks ago, I noticed what feels like a lump underneath my left breast. It’s decreased in size since and I can only feel it when I lie flat on my back. Maybe it was always there and I’m just noticing it because I’m hypochondriac but I notice it now... Should I be concerned? I’m freaking out like crazy because I have a history of breast cancer in my family but at the same time it’s not actually in my breast. It’s in that area that people sometimes put deodorant on and get rashes on. See below pic for reference.

throwawayb122019,1596865284,"I had a regular screening mammogram and it came back with an asymmetry visible in one breast on one of the two views only. So, today I went back for a diagnostic mammogram.

They ordered two more different views to try and see whether the original finding was an image artifact or actually something there. After that, the tech. Came back in and said the doctor wanted two more views. So, I guess they still couldn’t tell what was going on. 

Then, they came back and said I needed to go get an ultrasound. The tech. looked on the ultrasound for about 20 minutes in this small area but, apparently, couldn’t find either a cyst or a mass.

Now, they have scheduled a stereotactic biopsy so they can see this area of “density” to try to sample it. The doctor said they can see it on more than one of the views, so it isn’t an artifact and they couldn’t make it disappear with different angles of compression as might be expected from normal tissue. But, she also said it still could be normal or hormonal and if they can’t find it on the day of biopsy, they won’t do the biopsy!

Has anyone encountered something similar to this? The original description from the screening mammogram said, “nodular opacity, 1cm” and “asymmetric density.”

I’m 49, perimenopausal with wacky hormones."

I asked the doctor ""Is there any way this could be a fibroadenoma, or fat necrosis, etc."" and she was like ""Well, those are the most common lumps found in breasts, but what you've got is concerning"" blah blah blah.

Apparently they found a 6mm nodule around the prior cancer site. They are ordering an ultrasound and a biopsy ASAP.

Tapir_Tabby,1596748991,"2 years ago today, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Wowza – I feel like I’ve lived a lifetime in that two years. I thought, especially in light of the fact that I and two others are now going to be working to increase the helpfulness of the sub, it might be helpful to get to know our stories a little better. Below is my story (TLDR at bottom):

2018 was a BAD year. I broke up with the man I was planning to marry in January, only to find out that he had cheated on me for a year, and he begged me back after I got diagnosed when he (upon being questioned) admitted that one of the reasons was because he would finally be able to take care of me and be the ‘cancer boyfriend’ – a story for another time.

I was working like crazy on a software implementation and pulling like 80 hour work weeks out of state, when I found a lump in my left breast. I’ve had roughly 20 from the age of 17 on, and they were always nothing, so I didn’t really even think about it, but checked on the progress regularly.

I had my annual visit with my OBGYN in August, and assumed I’d just get it checked then. I had a trip planned to San Francisco in early July, and ended up getting upgraded to first class (yay for business travel), and sat next to a nurse who randomly had just hit her 5 year mark from BC, so I started peppering her with questions about it, and asked her to feel my lump and tell me what she thought. 

She was amazing and agreed – said it might be something, might be nothing, but that I should get it checked sooner than later, and we made plans to meet for a drink at a later stage (we had both gone through a faith crisis recently as well – we were both raised in a VERY demanding religion and leaving is BRUTAL).

Moved up my appt with my OBGYN and they referred me for diagnostic mammo and ultrasound (the lump was close to my sternum so not easy to get a read on it using just mammo). That was done and they recommended a needle biopsy, as they’d found another area of concern as well. That was scheduled for Thursday. 

That weekend I took my niece and nephew so my brother/SIL could celebrate their anniversary until Monday. Monday morning I got a phone call from my OBGYN ‘checking in to see how I’m doing’….uh, what? Why was she calling? Under her breath she said ‘those assholes’ and I knew I had cancer. She’d known since Friday morning and radiology was supposed to have called me then.

Within a week, I’d had an MRI and scheduled an appointment with general surgeon, and plastics (lucky I got in so quick!), and was told I had two sizable tumors – 1.6 to 2 cm each, and scatterings throughout the left breast. Nothing in the right, and didn’t look like the lymph nodes were impacted, but we’d know more after surgery.

In the US, you sort of have one chance to decide your overall options for removal with insurance - Lumpectomy v mastectomy, one side v bilateral, nipple sparing v not and reconstruction method. I’d already decided I wanted a double mastectomy and nipple sparing, so all good. I was scheduled for surgery the following Friday (11 days post diagnosis).

Mastectomy went fine, but they took 9 lymph nodes, and 5 came back positive. While awaiting other scans, etc. I set about to recover. About a month in, I started spiking fevers and couldn’t get it under control. My plastic surgeon took a look at it and scheduled surgery, as I seemed to have an infection. Surgery to remove the tissue expanders and clear out the infection was about a month after my mastectomy. 

The infection turned out to be MRSA, and I dealt with that until around February of 2019, when I had to have part of my rib shaved down because MRSA had gotten in to my bones and my blood. I still deal with infections every time I have surgery. Additionally, I’ve been on heavy antibiotics for the better part of the last two years. Sigh.

Started chemo in October 2018 – 6 treatments with chemo, and then continued immunotherapy until October of 2019. Lost my hair and was REALLY sick for all of chemo. Graduated from chemo in January of 2019, and 25 total radiation treatments happened February and March. 

During my PET scan, they found a sizable tumor on my right ovary, so in May 2019 I had surgery to remove the tumor and both ovaries/tubes (so no more birth control – yay!). Reconstruction has been….interesting. I had the latissimus dorsi flap surgery done, and as of only two weeks ago, have two normal-ish breasts again.

I’d say that’s my whole story, but you guys all know it’s never really over. The stuff I’ve dealt with since has been awful in a whole new way….chemo brain, depression, apathy about life, loss of friendships because people think they know what caused my cancer (spoiler alert – cancer was my fault), and how I should live my life now.

TLDR: Diagnosed August 6th, 2018 with 3C DCIS. MRSA, 11 surgeries in 23 months, and still sort of reeling from all the after effects."

One of the issues I’ve noticed on this subreddit is posts for research surveys. I looked at one that I thought asked some sensitive information in a google doc.

I’m considering how to handle these posts and would like your input.

Since I was diagnosed with cancer in the beginning of July, she acted really weird. She said some generic nice things on the phone like ""You will beat this"" and ""I am praying for you"" but then I found out she was saying to other family behind my back that it isnt a big deal (cancer is by far the scariest most depressing thing to happen to me). We used to be super close before this. I told her I couldnt come visit her and the new baby while I was in treatment because I am at a higher risk for covid now. She got very angry and since she has blocked all communication with me. When you told close friends or family about your cancer did anyone cut you off like this?

Uhtcearest,1596664146,"To give you a complete picture, my grandmother died from cancer (first uterine which was removed, then breast which was also removed, but then it spread to her blood I think and was everywhere, I was young and family didn’t want to explain to me), and my mother had two lumps removed (to my knowledge). I was aware of the fact that I was high risk, since I also had fibrous or very dense small breasts and my doctor at the time (16) told me to get an ultrasound every 6 months. My mother has always been very careless with me in general, she had me young and divorced my father when I was 1, and from then on my grandmother raised me until she passed away. Also around 16 I had some eye issues which were urgent and my father sent my mother the money, but she spent it and long story short, I almost lost my eyesight at 21. Because of all this and just straight up toxic behavior, I moved out. Right before moving out she was helping me get some exams done on my breasts because I had felt multiple lumps. I got an ultrasound and had around 7-11 modules per breast. I kept these results. She then took me to another doctor, that had treated my grandmother, who ordered multiple tests. These tests I was also supposed to keep for my check up but my mother took them from me, luckily I knew of her behavior so when I picked them up I took pictures. This was last year around June, and she never took me to the consultation to have the exams analyzed. Since I moved out I’ve been struggling with food and rent so medical issues were the last thing on my mind, but I recently started dating my best friend who’s studying medicine, told him the story and he asked to see the pictures of these exams. To be honest, after taking the pictures I never really looked at them, so I was kind of shocked when he told me I _needed_ to get checked out because the exams showed multiple palpable lumps, had BIRADS 4b and was _strongly_ (in black bold letters) told to get biopsy. He told me it could be nothing but it could also be something and it was better to be safe than sorry. It’s been I’ve a year since these exams, I’ve been feeling a grape size ball kind of grow, and have had a bit of pain (for instance, when my cat walks over me and steps on this breast, I get a sharp pain that lasts a couple minutes and then the pain fades but there’s a dull feeling left, like an echo of pain.). I just want to know if anyone had a similar diagnosis at first and was found to have breast cancer, I just want to be aware of the odds and maybe the procedure. I’m saving up for the consultation and exams, which are over 350 dollars (third world country, don’t have a stable job, had to leave the room I was renting cause I couldn’t afford to pay anymore so I’m staying at an aunts house that is empty, taking care of the house, but I’m no where near the amount I need). Does biopsy hurt? I’m very calm because I don’t like stressing out over things I can’t control, and I know there’s a chance it’s nothing but I would like to hear some of your stories if you were in similar position. Thank you for reading, I’m sorry for so much detail.

Ps: even though I’m struggling economically, my cat is very well taken care of, I had a bit of money from working in a fair as a hostess so first thing I did was buy a BIG bag of food, to last me all year, and a big bulk bag of kitty litter, so that no matter what my economic situation was, I knew she had what she needed, just in case anyone was worried :)"

Filled the freezer and deep cleaned the apartment. Also taught my SO how to cook a basic meal, everyone survived, no one got food poisoning! 

Got a haircut and tried an undercut out...kinda makes the back of my head look like a pie chart...maybe not going to do that in real life.

IamVanshika,1596629717,"Breast cancer is the abnormal growth of cells localized in breast tissues. It is one of the most common types of cancer found in women across the globe. Breast cancer is not specific to women only. It can occur in men, as well, however, such cases are not frequent.

A complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors predicts the development of breast cancer. We can’t choose our genes, but we can choose a healthy lifestyle. Here are 7 ways to make smart choices in life to defeat breast cancer.

**1. Physically active lifestyle**

A physically active lifestyle is a golden key to prevention from several health risks. Studies provide evidence for the fact that inactivity can severely increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Each week a woman should target 75 minutes of vigorous exercise or 150 minutes of moderate exercise to reduce the risk of breast cancer and many more health ailments. 

**2. Consume alcohol in moderation**

Excess of everything is harmful. The same goes for alcohol. Women who consume alcohol in moderation or abstain from it are less likely to suffer. Sofia Merajaver, M.D., Ph.D., suggests that women who take 2-3 drinks a day are at a 20% greater risk of developing breast cancer. If your alcohol intake is high, try cutting down to 3-4 drinks a week is a healthier lifestyle choice. 

**3. Healthy Diet**

What you eat is reflected in the overall functioning of your body. One should be careful and avoid reckless food choices. Studies report that eating a balanced diet can help reduce the risk of various health ailments. Incorporate fruits and vegetables into your diet and steer clear of tobacco.

**4. Avoid Birth Control Pills**

Hormonal contraception tools such as birth control pills and IUDs increase the chances of breast cancer while on the pill. This link has especially been tracked in women above 35. Consult your doctor about safety measures because consultation costs less than [breast cancer treatment](https://www.maxhealthcare.in/our-specialities/cancer-care-oncology/conditions-treatments/breast-cancer).

**5. Breast Feed**

The data indicates that women who don’t breastfeed once in their life increase the chances of suffering from breast cancer manifolds. Breastfeeding is not just healthy for the babies but also mothers. A woman who breastfeeds for more than 18 months in her life has significantly reduced the chances of breast cancer.

**6. Post Menopausal Hormones**

Hormone therapy is employed as a treatment of many chronic ailments. However, long term usage of postmenstrual hormones has a mixed effect on the body of a woman. Hormones therapies with estrogen-only or a combination of estrogen and progesterone significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. 

**7. Maintain healthy weight**

After menopause, women’s estrogen comes from fat tissues. Therefore being obese significantly increase estrogen levels in the body resulting in a greater risk of breast cancer. Therefore, monitor your weight and adopt healthy practices to remain fit. 

Over the time, **breast cancer treatment** has come a long way. With the advancement of knowledge and technology, there are multiple courses of treatment. Tremendous improvement in cancer survival rates doesn’t give you a ticket to live life recklessly. There are multiple physical as well as psychological side effects when one goes through the extensive treatment employed for cancer patients. We all bear the consequences of our choices. Choose wisely."

She and my dad don't trust conventional medical treatment and she felt like her oncologist was giving her confusing and contradictory answers, so she's decided to try to treat it with alternative methods instead (mostly nutrition). 

I have a lot of health anxiety and trying to learn about how breast cancer treatment works by myself (so I can pass it on to her since she might actually listen to me) is difficult/impossible without someone with actual medical knowledge to help me. I know barely anything about oncology and I can't do this all myself.  

I'm more than happy to pay for a Dr (or anyone, I am desperate) to advise me but I can't find anyone to do so. My PCP wasn't able to talk to me about it at all, and so far I haven't been able to convince an oncologist to give me an appointment since I'm not a cancer patient. My PCP did refer me to a genetic counsellor and I'm waiting to get on their books. 

There is nothing I would like more right now than to talk to someone with actual medical knowledge about this. Everything I've tried so far hasn't let me do that, and everything I've googled has been confusing and scared me even more. 

Please, I would be so grateful if someone could point me in the right direction to getting an appointment with an oncologist (even though I'm not the patient), or a professor of cancer medicine, or anyone with actual medical knowledge. I'm more than happy to pay, I just need someone to give me a chance. 

Thank you so much for reading this, posting here is one of my last ideas to try and get some professional help involved in this situation, otherwise all I'm left with is google."
ams800910,1596572670,I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year at the age of 38. I had a mastectomy and went through chemotherapy. I just had my reconstructive surgery last week and feeling pretty good now. I did do genetic testing and found that I have lynch syndrome which may or may not be related to my breast cancer. It increases my chances of many other cancers. I struggle with living with constant thought that I will have another cancer diagnoses in the near future. What are some ways you try to cope with moving on with life? I’m not particularly religious so I think it makes it harder to finding the meaning to life. Are there any good books that help with such subjects?

I asked my oncologist about what kind of foods to avoid/eat and he said to avoid soy and to follow a Mediterranean diet.  Have any of you heard of that? He said to avoid red meat (or limit to once a month). I have Googled some of it but it's contradicting so I'm confused.

I just wanted to know your thoughts on what you have all done. My one friends who went through it went to a plant based diet. I love meat so I don't know if I could do that.  

But your input with help me with this new chapter in my life. I also have a feeling I'll be making my own separate meals from my family.

love-the-storms,1596506440,"I have a mastectomy scheduled in the morning and am so scared. “Chemo brain” has affected me so bad; that on the last visit with my surgeon, I could only think of one question to ask. Of course after I left, the questions hit me like crazy! 

The hospital I’m going to is very strict with it’s Covid-19 procedures. The one question I had asked the surgeon was about the Coronavirus. They have zero patients with the virus. That eases my mind quite a bit but I’m still concerned. 

Can any of you tell me what to expect after my surgery? I’m told that if I have no problems or issues, they may send me home the same day. I don’t understand that at all!

I realize that no two surgeries are alike and the healing process is different for everybody. Guess I’m looking for the “cheat codes” to get through this ordeal. What helps ease the pain? What makes the pain worse? Is the surgery spot hard to keep clean? What is the best sleeping position? 

Right now, I’m more concerned with the surgery and getting through the days that follow. My mind is also very preoccupied with the mental aspect of losing a breast. I have so many things rushing through my mind and I’m scared of it all. For the time being, I want to focus only on the surgery and the immediate days following.  I honestly don’t want to think about the mental side of things. I just don’t want to deal it right now."

missnora89,1596476882," February of 2018 at 29 years old, I went to my doctor to remove my IUD and start trying to have a baby. Instead of the green light to my journey of procreation, I was scheduled for ultrasound, then mamo, than biopsy, mastectomy, chemo, radiation, 5-10 of hormone therapy .... Long story short I am 10 months in to ovary suppression (lupron) and aromatase inhibitors (arimidex) and the thought of waiting another year truly breaks my heart. Has anyone else gone through this, or thinking about going through this? I am feeling pretty alone since all of the bc survivors I know were postmenopausal.

catsanddrpepper,1596474821,"Hi guys, I don’t have confirmed breast cancer (might not have it at all), and I’m crazy anxious for my breast ultrasound tomorrow. 

Some background, my right breast had discharge that was abnormal for me. Green! I felt gross and checked my other breast, and the other one had clear discharge. My right breast is bigger than my left now, with ongoing tenderness and sudden sharp pains in both every now and again. I work in the military with some crazy hazardous chemicals, so I made my appointment with the doc. Usually appointments in the military take weeks to schedule, but on a Tuesday afternoon I got one bright and early Wednesday morning for my breasts. 

My doc did a full blood panel, noticed an elevated hormone commonly associated with milk production (relief!) and then immediately said he was consulting an endocrinologist and scheduling me for a breast ultrasound. (Relief gone! Anxiety!) 

I have other symptoms that seem so strange and unrelated, but now that I’m thinking about them they seem scary and preemptive. Like full body itching that doesn’t go away with a hot shower or good lotion, and random twitches of my legs and abdomen. I don’t even know what to do anymore, and I’m scared out of my mind. Something is wrong with me, I can feel it in my gut, but the military being what it is (and my gender factoring into that stereotype of malpractice) I’m worried that they’ll just try to appease me. 

I really hope that I’m not out of line posting in this sub, I’m just reaching a hand out hoping that someone has either experienced my symptoms or can talk me down."

Despite the fact that I find this message a bit cynical for newly diagnosed patients...

There had been several posts lately saying, how draining it is as a patient to be asked for diagnosis or advice from non-diagnosed persons. Maybe we can reduce such friction with a sub description that explicitly tells, whom and what to expect here, and what not.

What do you think?"

They recommended I go for a yearly mammogram and I am due for one again soon here which is good because my left breast seems to have grown a bit more and is still sore on and off and the lump to me feels bigger in size... and one thing that is freaking me out is the fact that when I squeeze my breast this clearish type discharge comes out and I have had a hysterectomy so I am not pregnant .. it is only coming out of one breast and I do have a video that I could post and some photos if anyone is willing to maybe help me out ?

I am a private person so I’ve only shared with my spouse, parents, and siblings. I have 2 young kids and am terrified. I know there is only a 20% chance that it is anything other than benign and that I’m young and that lowers my chances as well. With my family history I can’t help but sit and visualize the worst.

Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional, nor a chemist. I'm just another BC fighter who happens to have the hobby of researching random stuff online.  If it's a topic that's important for me or my family, that's where I dive so deep I need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find my way back. I found this during one of those deep dives.

Wound care is important, but we also want it to heal fast and hopefully minimize scaring. I think I found something that might help y'all with that. It did me good. 

I stumbled across this last year before my DMX.  I had always though that essential oils for actual medical purposes was a load of crap (still think most are).  Note this is not some pseudo-science crap, this is straight from National Institute of Health (USA), a study THEY did.   


Long story short, they took a bunch of rats and made identical incisions in each. 'Control' group was those that received standard wound care. The 2nd group received no care. The 3rd group had pure lavender oil used on the wound.  If you want to dive into the study yourself (find an online medical dictionary if you're not a professional) the link is at the top of this post.

  


[Easy to see which ones healed the quickest.](https://preview.redd.it/gz02ugd5vke51.jpg?width=567&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203a2ca0ea7b2b2793a12685bda98379c5019213)

I mentioned this to my CNP and Surgeon and asked if they had heard of it. (didn't have a smart phone to dig it up at the time). When the surgeon started in on a 'Dr Google' joke I interrupted him and said 'It's on the NIH site you can find it yourself'. (this was last year, before he learned not to crack that joke at me). Now my hospitals have an app where I can send links like this directly to my CNP and/or surgeon.   


I figured if it did so good for the rats with a tiny cut, it might do me a bit of good (if nothing else help me relax, eh?). I use coconut oil as a moisturizer after showers because the skin soaks it up like a sponge (great for so many uses besides cooking). Along with the standard wound care I started using a mixture of 1/4 cup coconut oil with 5-6 drops of lavender oil (stir well) I got from our local pharmacy; Not food grade lavender oil, just plain old essential oil (about $8 for a tiny bottle here). I use a small glass jar like what pre-diced garlic comes in. Just scooped enough to cover my finger tips, smeared exclusively on the DMX incisions at first, shower every day and damn I was getting results! Especially after the skin glue came off! Even the surgeon was surprised at the 2 week checkup. 6 wks checkup he was shocked at how nice and clean the area looked and how well it healed. He actually looked it up then. 'Dr Google' my ass :P   


Note that it didn't help much with the itchy as the wound heals, for that I use an antibiotic ointment with numbing. I'm trying to figure out how I can mix the lavender oil with numbing antibiotic ointment, not sure of what ratio to use, maybe a drop or two per teaspoon? Waiting to find a small enough glass jar to try it. (I'll update if I can pull it off and let y'all know those results, IMO it's an experiment worth trying.)  


My arms always have some kind of scratches on them. We have 3 cats (none of which like me too much, except when I'm feeding them) and 2 dogs who seriously need nails clipped and I'm too paranoid to do it. While the cats scratch maliciously the dogs do it on accident, especially my pup Canis, he gets a little excited while we're playing lol.  When using the coconut/lavender mix on my arms and the scratches heal in a few days instead of a week or more. Doesn't stop more scratches from coming lol, but at least my arms don't look as bad as they used to.  Any extra on my hands I put on my face and throat... IDK if it helps with wrinkles lol but it sure feels nice and smells so good! Sometimes after a bath I'll splurge and use that for all over moisturizer instead of the regular plain coconut oil, esp if I'm showering before bedtime. I've also noticed over the past year using that my skin's texture is changing for the better and older scars are fading slightly. I've even gotten my guys to daub a little on cuts and they heal a bit faster, long as I can get them to do it every day for 3 or 4 days. My younger sister gets keloid scars even from a tiny scratch. She promised she would try it next time to see if it helps with healing, maybe it'll minimize the bump. (If y'all want I'll update and let you know how it worked for her).   


I've seen some beautiful tattoo work used to cover DMX scars and want to go that route. My oldest son does tattooing, but won't touch scars because they can be tough (understandable, too bad I wanted him to do the work). Most tattoo artists that do want you to wait at least 12-18 mo post op. 8 mo after DMX I asked him to check and he said it was almost ready. at 10 mo post op he said he thought it would handle it.  I should have had him at least do the outline work before this last surgery. Now I've got to wait longer :(   


Note that coconut oil is a soft solid at room temp (25°C/75°F) and melts at body temp (37°C/97°F) so once you scoop it out of the jar be quick about putting it on. I don't store it in the bathroom where it always gets hot and steamy (fridge it will get really hard) And I always use the small glass jars to mix/store it in, not plastic or tupperware.  I don't just use it after bath, i'll use it anytime I think about it, at least once a day. Don't wipe it off like you would using just the plain oil. Leave it on (unless you've got sticky bandages to put on, then wipe those areas. but try your best to leave it directly on the incision). Oh and keep it away from dogs. They love to lick coconut oil as much as peanut butter, but I've read that lavender can be toxic to dogs. Don't think it bothers cats, I didn't look tbh.  


Hope this helps someone out as much as it helped me. We're all fighting this same war in our own way and we need every weapon in our arsenal we can scrounge up."

In october the lump came back..another biopsy confirmed that.. now this disease is agony.im grateful it's not cancer but at the same time there is no set cure for this and all the inflammation is raising my chances of it turning into cancer.

Yesterday, she found a new lump in her breast near where the old one was taken out. She’s going to make an appointment and get examined. I read online that often there can be scar tissue or fat necrosis in the breast near where the incision was made and where radiation was used. It sounds like it could be this but you really never know.

oiyeahnahm8,1596245064,"A bit of background info, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March at age 30. It was just as covid was really ramping up in my country so as many others have experienced, I have gone to all my treatments alone. I have a very supportive partner and I really do count my blessings for that.
I have had a lumpectomy, some lymph node removed and a second surgery to clear a margin. I have completed TC chemo and am starting radiotherapy in the next couple of weeks. I've copied okay so far, chemo hit me quite hard which seemed to surprise my onco Dr considering my age, but mentally I've been doing okay. 
I've started Zoladex and the only side effects from that are the hot flushes. What I'm most concerned about now is starting Letrozole and what it will do to my moods, my mental health has always been a struggle to maintain, in diagnosed with PTSD, depression, anxiety and some aspects of a personality disorder. Is anyone able to share their experience with Letrozole? I'm not necessarily looking for my mind to be eased, just honest experiences so I can have an idea what I might be in for.

Should I take my mom to the ER now to get surgery? We have doctor's appointment on Monday but I don't know when they will do the surgery. I'm really scared and don't want it to spread to her other parts.
Hereiwait,1596236106,"Hi all 
I was diagnosed with bi-lateral breast cancer in April. I’ve gone through everything alone - my boyfriend was able to accompany me to one appointment due to covid restrictions. I’ve driven myself to hospital to hear dreadful things, I’ve had numerous biopsies and a magnet put in my breast, drove home alone after that. 
Had to self isolate for two surgeries alone in my flat. 
It’s difficult for me to be with my boyfriend as he has joint custody of his 7 year old so they worried about infection. 
They were adamant I had to be alone pre surgery, now I’ve got 16 weeks chemo and I’m going to be alone during that. 
I live in Edinburgh and all the support services are closed due to Co-vid.
I’d just love a pal, it’s been so lonely. Thanks to you all, this sub is great. X"

salankapalanka,1596169149,Has anyone had this issue? My mammograms both show an area of concern but the ultrasound tech was unable to find it and was confident that I have nothing to worry about.

PrecociousPlaty444,1596144255,"Hello! I have not been diagnosed, but have been experiencing some symptoms that elicited a reaction out of my doctor that I haven’t seen before. She mentioned imaging is a potential. 

Quarter-sized rash on my left breast near the cleavage area. Extremely itchy. I thought it was psoriasis (though I have never had psoriasis before).

Swollen lymph nodes near my armpits on both sides. They are both very tender to the touch. 

My left breast has felt warm since the rash started. Almost a burning feeling. It is noticeably different than my right breast. 

My doctor is treating me with antibiotics now, but said it could be viral— doesn’t make sense to me either. My first thought was wondering if COVID affects breast tissue?? (Half joking). 


Anyways, I’m not a mother so I don’t think it’s a breastfeeding-type issue.

calliemhart,1596063176,"I wanted to bring awareness to hereditary breast cancer and the gene mutations that are linked to a moderate-high increased risk of breast and other cancers. While BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most researched so far, all of the following mutations studies have shown to be linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Knowing that your cancer is hereditary can lead to a personalized preventative care plan for you that may include more frequent screenings, medications, and preventative surgeries to decrease your future cancer risks. If you have been previously diagnosed with one or more cancers, Concierge Health's multi-gene panel testing for hereditary cancer risk may be a resource for you to find out if you have a hereditary cancer syndrome, and discover inherent risks to children, so they can be proactive as well.

qwasymoto,1596056211,"I visited Planned Parenthood yesterday because I've been having breast pain, numbness, and other symptoms are not typical for me. The physician I saw was very kind, but did not thoroughly explain the remainder of the process of what I needed to do for further evaluation, which she strongly recommended. 

I don't have a primary care doctor at the moment. I am working on finding one, but my insurance is not great, and the people that have been referred to me are not accepting new patients. 

I was given a referral to see a breast specialist in my city. I found a couple of them, and they require referrals, which I expected. One that I talked to today was very rude. She didn't even let me fully explain my problem, instead saying, ""You need to make sure you're even supposed to come here before you waste our time."" The comment caught me off guard. I assume she was referring to me making sure that I correctly understood the type of referral I was given, but it was written clearly, and I have a basic understanding of the process for these things.

I asked if she could reach out to the office to get the referral, as it is on file, and she insisted I reach out to them myself. 

None of the other offices allow me to speak to a person or leave a message unless it's for a specific physician. 

I just want to talk to someone about what's going on, but I feel I've hit a dead end.

The protocol is not AC-Taxol (I forget the name), it is less aggressive, done over nine weeks.

I am comfortable with my choice, but I just feel branded when I go outside. Granted, I am not leaving my house much with the pandemic, but when I go for walks or drive around people stare. One time on my walk someone asked if they should be praying for me. I just miss my normal life. I'm 26 years old. I want to enjoy my youth. Instead I have to endure this, with a pandemic on top of it all. When I look in the mirror I don't see someone I recognize. I miss brushing my hair, getting my eyebrows threaded, putting on mascara, feeling pretty. I feel like I'm forever marked as the girl who got breast cancer at a young age. I don't want it to define my life, but I'm sure it will. I am mourning for who I was before my diagnosis and trying to come to terms with the new me - bald, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, pale, anemic, exhausted.

She is young (43) and in generally great shape so she expected to handle the treatment well but it has been really tough. Very fatigued, terrible metal taste, constipation, considerable bone pain, etc. Nothing we were not told to expect, she just expected more fight from herself - and that this has hit her so hard has triggered a sort of depression at the low points. She bounces back and me and the kids give her all kinds of support - but this is just way harder than she imagined.  


One more AC treatment to go, then we transition to 12 weeks of Taxol.

Bennnniiiiii,1595984304,"Hi everyone, I came hoping for some advice as I'm lost on this. 

My mum has Breast Cancer, it's a 6.3cm long. She had a lumpectomy, but a biopsy after the operation showed cancer left behind, and Surgeons said she needed to have a mastectomy with lymph nodes checked.

I'm very much with the modern medical side, whereas she believes in all sorts of stuff I consider completely useless, like psychic therapy and herbal remedies etc. etc. So it's been a big struggle to this point.

A CT scan currently shows no secondary cancers that are big enough to detect at least.

She made the decision today (final day) to only have the mastectomy and to follow these non traditional methods (like the psychic healing, reiki...) and not have the lymph nodes checked to see if it's spread.

This to me seems really illogical considering that she's going for a mastectomy anyway, and she is opting to have no further treatment (like chemo).

She is also concerned about the effects on the lymphatic system which I understand, but I think it's such an unnecessary risk when they're only needed to take a few.

I don't know if there is anything I can do other than hope for the best.

Given the size of the cancer, I'm just not feeling hopeful. It seems to be more likely that it could have spread.

If it has spread to the lymph nodes and we don't find out and take the right treatment options until months later, I worry it will spread and be too late.

I cared for my Grandmother who had terminal lung cancer, so I guess knowing what an awful experience that was makes me even more worried. 

I don't want to lose my Mum too, I feel completely devastated. 

If anyone has any advice on either the medical side (i.e options, whether I don't need to worry, ability to detect any cancer spread post mastectomy) or the personal side of things I'd really appreciate it. Really anything, I don't even know at this point. Thank you."

TerrifiedDaily,1595965072,"(Throwaway account cus idk if my family knows the user for my main or not)

Bit of background to give a little more context. My grandmother passed due to breast cancer, and I think PCOS runs in my family and supposedly some people with that also have Fibrocystic Breast Disease so idk if that is what this is.

So, a couple months ago, I noticed in my left breast I have a small lump that is kind of hard and feels attached to the side of my breast mound, near the base (Not near the nipple, more close to like, my chest wall I guess?). It moves with the mound rather than being a free-moving thing, and I don't have any pain, and at first it felt like it got smaller when my cycle ended (At that time, when it was small, I could barely find it.) but now it feels like it hasn't gotten smaller, and idk if it is because I can go long times between cycles and so maybe it just hasn't gotten there yet but it makes me concerned.

I know, I should get checked, but I am only 18 so my mom would have to take me and stuff and I am under her insurance and I imagine the cost would be disgusting... and the thing is... what if it \*is\* something bad? My older sister is already has potential cancer concerns herself, and I don't want to concern my mom if it could be possible we both have cancer. I am freaking out and I worry everyday (Hence my username), but I don't want to ask to be checked with all that is going on with my sister."

My physician noted abnormalities in the size of my breasts - left one is smaller, right one seems to be more dense. It was difficult for her to feel anything, but I have large(r) breasts.

I have to go to a specialist due to the pain radiating in my underarm/breast, as well as a family history (paternal grandmother).

She did not really explain to me what they would be doing, just that she strongly recommended getting it further evaluated.

When I had my infusion on Wednesday, it went mostly fine. They had to slow the drip because of common reaction, ie: coughing and restless legs. 
All was fine. 
Next day came in for a shot to build blood cells. I have no idea what it was. Went in on Friday also. No one checked me first. Just injected. Apparently all my symptoms were classic for raised white and red blood cells. Really raised. 
I then went to ER. Of course they took blood first thing. I don’t believe they did anything with the blood they took. The nurse commented on how dark red and quickly the tubes were filled. I was unable to advocate for myself in the condition I was in. Because of COVID you cannot have your spouse in the ER with you. I had no one to advocate for me. I left there - they needed the room - with my BP at 211/141. 
Not sure what my next move will be, but I am sure there will be one. 
They gave me reglan to help the nausea. Had they checked CBC in the hospital there are measures that could have been taken to reverse it. Instead I am still dealing with the effects. Nausea, OMG I have had nausea before but this is what they write stories about. Reglan does not work for this nausea. I am currently waiting on it to be done before popping a promethazine (phenergan). That works.

julybaby98,1595902442,"This is going to be long and mainly me venting, so sorry in advance. 

I’m a bit of a hypochondriac. It was really bad when I was a teenager and it kind of calmed down until this pandemic started. I guess spending all my time in the house made me start worrying about dumb stuff again. 

I had a colon cancer scare and honestly, made myself sick about it. I was having digestion issues along with abdominal pain and blood in stool and I noticed once I went to the doctor and we took some tests, my symptoms and anxiety went away for the most part. While at the doctor’s office, I brought up a rash on my breast (around the areola) that wasn’t going away with the usual cream I use for my rashes (I have ezecma)

Sometimes she just prescribes me a stronger cream but she said she wanted to do an ultrasound on the breast. I thought nothing of it until the first question the ultrasound lady asks me when she sees my breast is if I have a history of breast cancer. All the cancer scare anxiety that I thought was gone, came back. 

I went home and took off my shirt and bra and looked in the mirror and noticed the breast with the rash on it was noticeably bigger than my other breast and also noticed redness around the breast. I had no idea if it was there before because I never really look my boobs lol. I also have these little dots around my breast which I assumed was because of my horrible skin but when I googled online I had a lot of the symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer. 

I know that this type of cancer is so rare but I really can’t stop thinking about it now. I went to the ultrasound today and the woman working there told me it would take a few days for my doctor to get the results. I should just wait it out but reading about this cancer and knowing that this type of cancer is known to be much more aggressive I don’t know how I’m gonna wait that long. 

I’ve also been having back pain for the past month which I assumed was because of the colon cancer I thought I had lmao. But now I’m thinking it’s already spread all over my body and every headache and little pain I get is just verifying that. I also am annoyed with myself for not going to the doctor as soon as I noticed the rash but honestly it looked exactly like my eczema at first and only recently has the other symptoms started. So I wouldn’t have really known. 

I understand how insensitive these posts are to people who actually do have cancer and are fighting, and how it can be offensive almost so I understand if no one wants to reply to this but I’ll definitely leave an update once I get my results or if there’s further testing."

Healthy_On_The_Cheap,1595787393,"I’m pretty anxious at the moment because of what is going on...I’ve had very dense tissue in my right breast for years. Always end up getting an ultrasound as a result with just a cyst that is just sitting there. Now I’ll let you know first, I’m extremely scared right now but don’t really wanna hear “oh everything will probably be fine” or something similar. I just want to hear if anyone else experienced something similar to me. 

So I got tired of going back every year, sometimes bi-yearly and gave up on getting them at all. 
Well, my yearly visit with gyn is coming up mid-August and I’d promised her I’d get one before our yearly appointment. She’s the doc who listened to me regarding my personality changes, skyrocketing anxiety, road rage a few times and said of course I’ll let you try HRT. It helped immensely but had to take her max dose of 2mg daily and even THAT wasn’t getting me close to what she was aiming for avg. blood level no more than 68. 

So I finally got it done this past week and here is the summary:

FINDINGS: 
The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense. Possible developing 
focal asymmetry is seen in the upper-outer quadrant of the right 
breast. Additionally, possible faint calcifications are seen in the 
upper-outer quadrant of the right breast. No suspicious masses, 
calcifications, or areas of architectural distortion are identified 
in the left breast to suggest malignancy.

I’ve also lost 22 pounds in the past few months since stay at home started *while* eating emotionally due to stress. I get intermittent fevers of 100° but not very often. 

They have me coming back in tomorrow for a *2 hour long* appointment! My past diagnostic ultrasounds were just a half hour long and bye. 

I’m just terrified because it just feels like it’s going to be something serious. I’ve been angry much of my adult life also and have bipolar depression and have since 16. I also cannot keep friends for the life of me because I end up cutting ties while in my deepest depressions. So I’m afraid this is going to be my karma. 

So, I’m just wondering if any of this feels familiar with any of this. Including the radiologist’s findings. 

PS I seriously should be gaining weight because I’m eating a LOT emotionally.

She’s on antibiotics and the infection is out of her system, but as a result, the incision bust open and while it is slowly healing, she still has an open wound on her chest :( To make things worse, the doctors are also suggesting chemo as well, to be started mid-August, so basically as soon as she gets to the end of THIS struggle she gets to start ANOTHER one. It’s been a rough go of it, and I know her mental health isn’t in the best place right now (not that I blame her!!). She’s scared and upset.

I’ve moved back in with her and I’m going to be living with her through the chemo treatments to take care of her. I just wanted to know if you had any advice for me. What do I need to know?? What can I do to make this easier for her?? If you went through chemo, what helped you??

RiriBuc,1595714801,"After going thru breast cancer 17 yrs ago, I (57F) feel a lump on the same breast. The first time, I had a lumpectomy, radiation, followed by Tamoxifen. It's almost like it never happened, except for one side being slightly smaller than the other one.  I've met people who've gone thru chemo, and one friend died at 41. I'm married for 5 years to a great guy, but I don't think he could handle the whole process. Before u bash him, even I don't want to deal with it.  I've had a great life, with ups and downs like everyone. I have grown daughters (who I love) and grown step-kids, a step grandkid  (that I'm not close to). Pretty close to my kids, not step kids. 

 Even though I haven't gotten a diagnosis yet, I find myself wanting to get rid of things I don't want and simplify my life so people don't have so much to dispose of. Covid will do that, lol. I'm a Christian and I'm not afraid of death, but I'll admit, I know I'll be very sad if it's cancer again. I know youll call me sellfish and tell me I'll cause my family sadness. Is it a moral failure that I'll not up for ""the fight""? I have a doctor's appt on Monday."
katnissme,1595701927,"I’m a 21 yr old women who has been on birth control 2 months now. The type of BC I’m taking each day has a significant amount of estrogen contained in the formula. I consistently eat a high-protein, high-estrogen diet - along with a healthy balance of other food groups throughout the day. I do full body workouts everyday. I also take estrogen based supplements to help my muscles grow (chest and booty included as I am trying to gain especially in that area). How much is TOO much estrogen intake? I want to have a healthy balance of my daily estrogen intake to gain and grow, but not to the point that I develop health issues down the road. I’ve also heard that a lot of estrogen consumed and produced in the body too close (and too much) in time will cause breast cancer.

Jaelanne,1595679615,"A year ago, I was going through the process to donate a kidney. I got the bloodwoork, took my blood pressure twice a day for two weeks, measured my urinary output, saw my doc for a physical.  Because of the history of breast cancer in my family, I had to get a mammogram.

I put it off for years. I did my self exams inconsistently. I'm ashamed to admit it because I *know* better. I'm a nurse *because* of my experiences with my mother's breast cancer. 

I was told I needed an ultrasound pretty much 10 minutes after the mammogram was ordered. I knew there was a problem before the sonographer put down the transducer. She had the radiologist call me in the clinic.  I was told to go back tomorrow for a fine needle aspiration. I was numb when I asked her if she meant a biopsy. She explained that there was probably nothing, and that of I preferred, I could get a repeat mammogram in a few weeks to see if it grows and go from there. (This was at Mammography Specialists in Morgan Hill, California, highly recommend)

I didn't. I'm a travel nurse, and my next contract was in the backwoods of central Florida, and the only place to get a mammogram was in the hospital I was working at. Hard nope, as it was easily the worst place I ever worked for. 

Now I'm in NJ, And have been so busy working 50 hour weeks on a COVID-19 crisis contract. I know I should have known better, but nurses make for rotten patients. 

Over the past few weeks I swear I can *feel* it getting bigger. My friends point out that I've lost at least 20 pounds, but I have been eating healthier, and riding my bike...so I convinced myself the lump isn't getting bigger, my breasts are just getting smaller. I'm always tired, but I haven't been sleeping (I'm just now sleeping through the night without COVID-19 nightmares waking me up). I blamed my symptoms on pandemic-related depression, isolation, etc.

This week my panic and depression hit fever pitch. I convinced myself that I am going to die. My insurance is crap, so I started researching moving back home with relatives in Switzerland (I lived there with my family as a child but I was born in the US) because at least I would get good healthcare. I reached out to a Canadian friend about moving up there. I stressed out about immunosuppression and pandemics and being all alone (I'm single, my family is all in Europe now). I've had nightmares, but now it's not COVID-19, it's my mother's frail body, her balding head and sunken eyes, her skin blackened and literally burnt from the awful 1980s era radiation therapy she went through, looking like a reanimated corpse. 

I can't talk to anyone, I don't have any family here. I can't eat, I can't sleep. So yesterday I got the needle. Of course on a Friday, so I won't know anything till Monday at best. I came to my hometown, even though most of my friends moved away, but I can't even visit with the friends I have left because of COVID-19.
And the friend I have visited (buds since college, she's always had a sofa available to me, and she's wonderful)...I don't want to dump this on her, she has massive problems too, just like everyone else during this shitty pandemic.

I should have taken care of this last year, I know. I'm normally a really strong person but I've spent the last week afraid and crying. 

Thanks for giving me a venue to rant. I guess I'm just looking for a support network.

I guess I just needed to vent to people that have been in this situation."

statusconference,1595646409,"My previous post discussed the merits of no surgery v surgery to prevent very high risk of breast cancer. I've been talking it over with my mum a bit recently and am leaning more towards getting the surgery done, but have loads of questions. I'll have to have a chat with my breast specialist at the clinic and the surgeon, but thought I might be able to learn more here.

Has anyone here waited to have the surgery until they had lost weight? I'm currently obese and need to lose at least 25kg, which I would hope to lose before the surgery. I have weighed far less than I currently do at various points in my life, and would rather not go through something like that while also dragging all this weight around.

Has anyone had the double mastectomy and reconstruction done either simultaneously or fairly close together? How long did it take you to recover? 

If you had quite some time between the mastectomy and reconstruction, how much time did you have to wait?

For anyone who has had the mastectomy and reconstruction, does the hospital provide physical therapy assistance? I was reading earlier that you can't lift anything for weeks or your arms over your head for weeks. How do you wash your hair? What did you do for exercise?

What were the financial repercussions like? I am extremely fortunate to have landed within the Australian public healthcare system where it's going to cost me nothing, but I worry about the recovery time. If I have to take 6-12 weeks off work, I will have to plan accordingly. At what point did you return to work, if you worked in an office job?

What was your mental health like afterwards and during the recovery process? How did you deal with it all? Was it a fairly isolating experience, or did you have enough supports?

Thanks in advance for reading and anyone who answers any of the questions!"

As of couple months back I started noticing that one of my breasts started really growing in size. It was always a bit bigger, but now the difference could be visible with untrained eye. It is especially visually concerning me when I am laying down because it kinda folds weirdly (semi graphic pic here &gt;!https://imgur.com/a/KiBaocr!&lt;) when squished and the nipple area as well as breast skin is extremely wrinkly on the top. It also sags MUCH MUCH MUCH further than the 'normal' breast and it just freaks me the fuck out in general.

I've had some skin discoloration on that boob diagnosed some time last year which is apparently very benign and cannot hurt any more than just make purple patches of skin according to the doc. Unsure if that is anyhow related but it seems like life really hates that breast.

I cannot find any info on this online and it doesn't really follow the breast cancer criteria either so im just. Scared?"

jesslynnica,1595614077,"My mother was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer about two months ago. She had a double mastectomy done on Tuesday with one node removed. 

I (23f) am in the medical field and my (22) sister is in college and offered to stay home during her recovery and I was going to be there after work and weekends. And both my mom and dad work for an amazing company that allows my dad to take time off with my mom. So she had plenty of help and a great support system as we read every book she did, read how to support her emotionally and physically, and what to expect. We’ve talked to the doctors over the phone and emailed. We were prepared. 

However. My grandma (mother’s mom) shows up from two states away. Planning to stay 6 weeks without zero notice from anyone. With her extremely at risk husband for covid. Leaving my sister and I who don’t live at home with no room to sleep in, and completely stressing my mom (and dad) out so badly she had a panic attack the day before her surgery. 

She shows up the Thursday before surgery. My mom had an appointment that day to get some discharge paperwork and prescriptions that could not be called in. She asked me to read through it and email any questions to the doctor since no one has been allowed to go to her appointment due to COVID. I read through them and had some questions as some information between the hospital and plastic surgeon contradicted each other. I also wrote down a few questions non related. (One paper said to shower 48 hours after another said after you first post op appointment which is 10 days after) My grandma reads them and says “this is says 48 hours, so I say she can shower then” to which is responded “you don’t get to make that choice, her doctor does” and she told me to stop being an inconsiderate brat. I type out the email with everyone’s questions and I left it on my laptop so anyone could add if they needed. I woke up the next morning and noticed it was sent. I read through and realized my grandma had deleted ALL of the questions we had and only sent hers. I asked her about it and asked why they were gonna and she said “I know those answers so I didn’t think they needed to be sent.” I ended up sending another email. 

The day before surgery, my dad asked who all was going with him to drop her off for surgery. I told him since the hospital was on my way to work so I didn’t mind taking her myself since no one could go in anyway. It was also early and an hour away from where we live. To which my grandma said “she isn’t a package you can just drop off” and I was like I didn’t mean it that way. Later that day my dad asked again and I was like I’ll drive separately since I have to go to work after anyway and my grandma goes “she doesn’t need a whole parade” I was hurt and she wasn’t understanding that I wanted to hug my mom before she was in the hospital for 3 days with no one. 

She has the surgery done on Tuesday and actually got to come home on Wednesday instead of three days. My dad and sister were on their going to get her without my grandma because she was napping and she called them and made them turn around to come get her. And yelled at them the whole time. My dad a very capable man, tried to help her in the car, and my grandma pushed him out the way to get her in. 

Once they get home my grandma isn’t allowing my sister or dad to help at all. With medicine. Bandages (which my dad FaceTimed my mom to learn how to do it from a nurse). Anything. Which really upset them. Then my mom showed them the scars and my dad and sister were telling them how good they looked and that they weren’t bad at all. And my dad told her she was beautiful still. And my grandma told them to “shut up they’re ugly” which if I had been there I’d ask her to leave. (This was a fact I didn’t know yet; she’d sent me a picture from the hospital and I told her they looked good)

so when I got home and she showed me I said “they look even better in person” and she broke down crying. I was finally able to come see her and she asked me to help her with drains and put the cream on because my grandma was refusing to put it everywhere where as the doctor prescribed. So I washed my hands and then put gloves on and she said your grandma doesn’t put gloves on her washes her hand before she does this. And when I say I about lost my mind, I almost did. I helped with her drains, got the cream on, gave her a pain pill (hopefully the right one but as I said she didn’t tell anyone what or when she was giving her and not like she could remember anyway) waited for her to go to sleep and asked my grandma why she wasn’t washing her hands before touching her. And she said “well if she doesn’t have to shower I don’t have to wash my hands. They must want her to build up immunity” and I was like excuse me? That’s not how it works. To which she started screaming at me for bringing COVID near her husband and that I shouldn’t even be allowed at the house while he’s there and telling me to leave. I didn’t. I sat on the couch. 

My sister texted me this morning saying my dad went to work and when I asked why, she said that my grandma sat them down and said that they should feel guilty for not helping our mom more and that we shouldn’t tell her she’s beautiful. So my dad got up and left. So my grandma assumed he left my mom (which he didn’t he just didn’t want to be rude) so my sister made a medication sheet so they could write down when how much and what she took. So we could help a little....

How are we supposed to handle 5 and half more weeks of this...or longer if she decides to stay throughout the reconstruction?"

jassch123,1595541931,"I'm a 24yr female. In 2017, I had a very small, painless, kind of rubbery pea sized lump in my armpit, no discoloring or anything. I went to a very well-rated dermatologist, who said she couldn't feel anything. I insisted, but she said it'd go away on it's own, as if she didn't believe that anything was even there. It got a little bigger, and I went back to her &amp; she told me the same thing. 

Flash forward several months, while visiting my parents— it was huge and painful, hard &amp; immobile. I went to an urgent care &amp; they gave me a referral to get an ultrasound. It came back as a risk level 4 on the BIRAD scale. They told me that there was risk for breast cancer. 

I went to a general surgeon and brought the scans &amp; report. He gave me some (anti-bacterial?) medicine to try and said it'd probably go away, nothing to be worried about. 

Well, I moved the next week across state, it never went away, and I never did anything about it. 

It's now 2020, so I assume that if it was serious, I wouldn't still be here? (I also don't know that much, so maybe that's too presumptuous?) 

It changes in size. It gets smaller &amp; larger, usually gets larger before my period. Most of the time, it's pea sized, immobile, kind of rubbery, and a solid shape. Yesterday, it was about the size of an avocado pit, extremely painful, rock hard, and pressing into my nerves (as it was causing burning). Today it's medium sized, kind of soft, and still immobile-ish. 

Other details: It's never come to a ""head,"" been red, or had any pus. 

It's been on my mind, because the last two weeks it's been causing nerve pain. I assumed it'll just get smaller once my period comes &amp; is over (as it usually does), but wanting to check it out again. 

I called back the original radiologist &amp; asked if they still had the files. They did and concerningly asked if I ever followed up with it? I explained the situation to them, and the woman responded saying ""Why did they have you go to a general surgeon and not an oncologist?"" I couldn't really remember, so I didn't comment. She then repeated I should get this checked out. 

In order for any speciality to be covered, I have to go through a primary care doctor, and it takes MONTHS to be seen. So trying to get some advice from people with lived experiences while I wait.

I'm assuming I shouldn't be concerned since I've had it for years, but would love anyone's thoughts. Does it sound like a cyst? Fibroadenoma? Tumor? Cancer?"
LinkNotLonk,1595529675,"Hi everyone.

For a few months I saw clear discharge coming from my left breast. Got an ultrasound, mammogram, core biopsy, another mammogram. Tests determined it was a very tiny intraductal papilloma. Benign. I met with a surgeon to get it removed and she wanted me to get an MRI done. After the MRI, radiology wants to schedule a second-look ultrasound? I was told I'd get a verbal report about the findings after this ultrasound.

What I thought was nothing is now worrying me. Has anybody gone through a similar  process where they were told something is benign and later find out it's more than that?

If this is in the wrong sub I can remove and post in the appropriate one. I'm 24F if that matters. 

Any advice or sharing of experiences would be appreciated."

beachyblue2,1595473233,"I’m 35F, and over a year ago I had an ultrasound because I found a lump, even though my doctor couldn’t feel it but I could so she referred me to get an ultrasound. The ultrasound technician ended up saying they didn’t see anything to be concerned with and that I have “dense breasts” even though they only ultrasounded the exact location of the lump and not anywhere else on my breast. I asked about that and the technician said for someone my age they only look exactly where the doctor noted the lump of concern was located on the referral. I thought that was odd. 

My doctor seemed satisfied with there not being anything found on my ultrasound so I let it go, even though in hindsight I should have pushed for more testing but I didn’t know how to stick up for myself. (I actually like my doctor but I think because she could never find the lump and the ultrasound came back fine that she didn’t think it needed more done about it).

Now in that same breast I can still feel that lump and I think it’s larger. It’s on the outer upper part of my breast, plus now I found (a few days ago) a pea-sized round lump in that same breast, same side but lower, that moves easily and doesn’t hurt. Overall, that whole breast feels dense and like there’s a lot going on in there, whereas my other breast doesn’t feel like any lumps or bumps are in there.

Now I really feel like I need to get it checked out again. I don’t know what the procedure for getting this in motion is or how to stick up for myself to get what I want. I’m thinking both lumps should be ultrasounded or a mammogram and biopsied? (I have small A cups so I’m not sure how well that works for a mammogram). Please anyone with experience with this process share tips for how I can be proactive to get this taken seriously."

It’s pre-cancerous. Doing the lumpectomy is the same thing as having a colposcopy when there are abnormal cells on your cervix or having polyps removed.” I had read and understood that DCIS is not considered cancer because it’s non-invasive but I guess what confuses me is if it’s the same as a colposcopy or having polyps removed then why are they saying I have to have the radiation and take tamoxifen for five years? I do not understand."

They say laughter is the best medicine, and the best comedy comes from the darkest corners if life. Sarcasm is an awesome coping mechanism in dealing with any issue that's hard to face. When it comes to an issue as serious as breast cancer it's real hard to find anything to laugh about it. In my 20 yr battle I've become a pretty good shot at firing that BFG ( ask a gamer what that means). It's how I've lasted this long.

This s a damn fine target we've been given.🧿 I invite y'all to step up to the firing range and take your  best shots. What funny rename would you call this disease? A bull's-eye would be one that makes us laugh so hard we pee our pants 😂

This is probably going to be a long post, but I think even if few people read this and commented it will make a difference to me.
I’m 44M, my wife is 41F, been happily married for 17 years, she’s the love of my life and all these years together I loved her more everyday, we have two daughters 7 years old and a 16 months old. 
All this happened within a week. My wife felt a lump on her right breast and got it checked, on the 7th of July the result came back as cancer grade 4. I’m not familiar with cancer nor the medical terms of what relates to it so I’m still slow on this field. 
X-ray showed that she has some “spots” on the liver and lung, doctors seemingly trying to show that its secondary and nothing to worry about and it will go with the chemotherapy, I’m not sure if that’s the case! They might be right but I have a feeling they don’t want us to panic. Until this point I’m coping with the whole situation just fine.

Today I got to know that the cancer reached the bones, now I’m really terrified as it seems now more serious, I read that this could be painful with the sudden pain and bones breaking. I CANT see my wife in pain and I don’t want her to be going through that, could the pain be controlled if it ever occurred? 

It’s really strange how life can change in matter of days, couple of weeks back she went for a lump in the breast and today we doing our first chemotherapy session!

My daughter asked me today “when is mom gonna feel better” she didn’t even see her in pain, she just saw us going to the hospital for few times. The hair loss and fatigue most probably yet to come! 

My wife doesn’t know about the bones yet, I couldn’t tell her for now. 

She told everyone in her family that’s she’s in stage 3 and there’s nothing to worry about. 

I never googled anything to do with this stage survival nor “how long can stage 4 live” I don’t want it to get in my head, I believe that we should have high hopes and be strong, my wife is being really strong and in high spirits, I’m extremely proud of her, but I’m afraid of what’s coming, I don’t want the agony overtake her.
I don’t know what to do, she’s the love of my life and my daughters mom.

I was basically told that nothing is wrong, they can't explain why I'm having these issues, good luck, and don't come back until I'm 40. They only did a sonogram and refused to do a mammogram even though they got paid for it. I've done a ton of research since this first started (read articles, watched videos, and looked at mammgram/sonogram images), and by no means am I an expert, but that sonogram did not look normal to me.

statusconference,1595236490,"Due to genetics, I am told I have a very high risk of breast cancer. The breast clinic specialist said the risk is 4-5x as high as the average person, the genetic counselling centre at the hospital said 85% (a figure I've seen often in medical journals relating to the syndrome).

I had a contrast MRI on 8 June 2020, a follow-up ultrasound on 22 June, a follow-up mammogram on 17 July - which turned into an impromptu biopsy and more mammograms that day - and I have a further MRI with biopsy in two days. I'm 30, and try not to think about all this, but with the second lot of biopsies in less than a week I'm getting a bit anxious.

I was advised recently to seriously consider a prophylactic double mastectomy. I don't want to do it because it's a long recovery time and I get very badly affected by post-operative depression. The alternative - which I have so far chosen - is an MRI and mammogram and possible follow-up ultrasound biopsy every year henceforth.

Am I mad for not doing the surgery? How do y'all deal with the waiting for scan/biopsy results? I don't deal well with uncertainty and waiting, and I think it's going to be another 14+ days before I get any results.

***Edit***

The hospital just called me and said the MRI machine has broken down and they can't reschedule until the necessary part arrives so the biopsies tomorrow have been cancelled. I'm stupidly upset because I'd been sort of psyching myself up to get through it and had organised a psychologist appointment beforehand and arranged to take a day off work, and now none of things are happening and I have to do it all again at some indeterminate point in the future. Now there will be even more waiting for things than I had anticipated, and that is the worst of it."

Three weeks ago I noticed that I had what looked like a few white vein-type things sticking out on the underside of my right breast. The internet gave me no answers and I spoke to my mother (an RN) and she had no idea. I decided to monitor. Last week I had what I believe was a bout of mastitis on the same breast. I had been prone to it with my son all the way up to 18 months. I did a 5 day round of 500mg 2x of ciprofloxacin and it cleared up.

However, the 'raised cobwebbing' has signifigantly expanded and grown and I'm unsure of whether or not it was mastitis related. I'll be making an appointment with my GP this week but of course with covid I am unsure of whether or not this is urgent or can wait. Any ideas?

I (19f) have always had a fear about having breast cancer ever since my friend’s mother (now recovered after having breast cancer twice) for a few reasons. The first being that I’ve had inverted nipples for a while (which I know I shouldn’t rely on the internet for medical advice, but with Covid and no health insurance, I won’t be able to get professional help for a while) and many say this might be a sign. I also recently developedwbay I believe to be “Subareolar abscesses” which are ‘an accumulation of pus that develops in breast tissue. They are most commonly caused by mastitis, but this can also occur in women who aren’t currently breastfeeding. Subareolar abscesses appear as a tender, swollen lump under an areolar gland. It’s often painful. In women who aren’t breastfeeding, this could be a sign of breast cancer.’ I fell small bump near my nipple under my areola that feels like a small ball and hurts a little to the touch.

MzOpinion8d,1595044989,"I had hair that was down to the middle of my back. My hair is also really thick. I had been growing it out for 3 years. I tried to stay positive about losing it, but it has been one of the hardest parts of cancer for me. I miss brushing it, and straightening it, and braiding it, and even putting it in a ponytail which is what I did with it most of the time lol. 

I had my first chemo on 9/13 and it started coming out 2 weeks later as they had predicted. I had my cousin (a stylist) shave my head for me so I’d have it all over with at once. We had fun with it - she gave me a perfect “Karen” haircut lol - and I did have three wigs that I used, but most of the time I wore hats. 

My last chemo was 12/27 so I’m about 6.5 months out now, and my hair is growing back. It’s the same color, and still mostly straight, but it just seems like it is taking SO LONG for it to come back. I’ve had dreams twice now where it was back to a more normal length and I was so happy and then I woke up to what I consider hideous hair! It’s growing back slower than average growth because I’m still getting one chemo med that fortunately doesn’t make me lose hair but it slows the growth. It will be at least Christmas before my hair is even close to where I want it to be at this rate.

I just needed to vent where people would understand. You know how people in real life can be - they just think I should be grateful to have gotten through the chemo and beginning to recover, and I completely am grateful for that, but there are some things that we lose during cancer treatment that people just don’t understand. Losing my hair has been far harder than losing my boobs (getting new ones helps a lot with that haha!).

Of course I did a google search and read something about fluid buildup that sometimes occurs, which is usually reabsorbed. I don’t know if that’s what it is, but I’m hoping so because that sounds not very scary at all. :p

daneslord,1595028274,"Mid-thirties male here. Extensive history of breast cancer in my family. My mother had a double mastectomy at 42 and is BRCA2. Both of her sisters had breast cancer (one didn't make it, the other refuses to get tested for BRCA), as did her mother. My grandmother's father and his father died of an unknown wasting disease (medical care wasn't super-advanced in pre-WWI Germany). 

I've got a lump in my left pec that has grown immensely in the last 3 months. It went from nothing to easily the size of a gumball. My family doctor said she doesn't think it's cancer because it's malleable and cancer is usually firm (we're praying for a blocked duct). But she did order a STAT mammogram. What should I expect? What is it going to feel like? What is the procedure? 

Also, I understand that mammograms are most often done on women. And that I will be in a space that is mostly populated by women who are staring mortality in the face. How do I, as a guy, make sure that I'm not making them uncomfortable? For me, losing a pec (boob) is no big deal. But I've been told that women take it very hard.

calliemhart,1595023765,"Certain inherited gene mutations can put you at an increased risk of developing one or more cancers in the future, but knowing you have these mutations can help personalize your preventative care, and help you manage your future cancer risks. Out of the following 11 gene mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most researched, and have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, which put women at increased risk of having multiple breast cancers, as well as ovarian cancer in a lifetime. However, having one of these mutations doesn't guarantee you will develop cancer.

For those who have already been diagnosed with one or more cancers, multi-gene panel genetic testing may be a useful resource for you to understand your risk of future cancers, diagnose possible hereditary cancer syndromes (ex: HBOC and Lynch syndrome), learn of opportunities for targeted therapies, and discover inherent risks to children. Staying informed can lead to early detection, prophylactic surgeries, and curated treatments. If you want to learn more about multi-gene panel genetic testing, I will provide a CLIA certified resource through Concierge Health: [https://kit.myconciergehealth.org/cgx?a=adv](https://kit.myconciergehealth.org/cgx?a=adv). Something to remember as well: genetic testing for young people who have NOT been previously diagnosed with cancer may lead to impacted long-term insurances. GINA (The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act) protects against health-insurance and employment discrimination due to genetic information.

Before I begin, i'm aware that when you google anything related to health you get the worst case scenario, like my elbow hurts, must be cancer, but besides the internet I have no resources.

Just curious .. I have been having a strange ache in my left breast for quite a while now, and I had an appointment with my nurse practitioner, and after her exam she said i'm alright and i'm too young for a mammogram; So two years later (I'm 28 now) the pain still resides, but now I've noticed that my breast almost goes to the side, and I had developed a small red blotch under my nipple that was flaky. I googled the early signs of BC and those were what had come up, so I called 811 and spoke to a RN and she had suggested to see a doctor within three days. My doctor books appointments 2-3 month down the road so that's not possible. It's been about a week and the spot is still there but after i had showered and whatnot the flake had gone away and it lightened up a bit.

So my question is, if the spot had lightened up, is there an urgency to get tested? I just don't want to go to an ER and them tell me that my mind concocted the symptoms after over thinking and researching online (which had happened to me the year prior when they turned me away saying I needed to stretch more when in all actuality I had blood-clots in my leg, and because I needed to go back, they had made their way to my lungs).

Breast cancer runs in my family, and I understand that sooner i'm tested the better, but with our healthcare system in shambles with covid right now I don't know if they'll treat me or take me seriously if I don't think there's something incredibly, immediately wrong. So wait 3 months to see my doctor or risk the 8-12 hours in the ER being exposed to everything that's going on right now and having the possibility of being shrugged off."

Obviously I know that everyone responds differently and some people get very lucky and some do not - but how functional were you during your treatment? On my optimistic days I'm like ""oh, I'm sure I'll have to take a day here in bed here or there during treatment but I'm sure overall I'll be able to do most things just with less energy"", and then on my pessimistic days I'm like ""I'm going to spend the next 20 weeks bedridden unable to move or even think"", and I imagine the truth is somewhere in between.

I saw my oncologist for my six-month post-surgery check-in and he said it was strange but could very well be from tamoxifen. I added in Claritin (per a commenter's suggestion) and the pain has largely gone away which is great. 

My oncologist also had me get an ultrasound of lymph nodes on both sides that looked like there could be an issue in my last PET scan. Both looked fine (which is great). 

I also had bloodwork done and some of that is all over the place. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cell count were low (suggesting anemia), but my ferritin is high and other iron tests all in the normal range. My lymphocyte and monocyte counts are quite low and my granulocytes are high. This is all complicated by my having an autoimmune disease that could also be affecting these numbers. 

My oncologist is away for the next week but hopefully this is either related to my other health issues or is just a blip. It definitely has me even more concerned about COVID-19 since these numbers suggest I'm more prone to infections."

Koalio15733,1594757064,"TL:DR I have a large lumpy growth and I'm getting it biopsied tomorrow. I could use some advice and support as I don't really have family to go to.

Hi everyone! I feel the need to share my story so far. I am 42 going on 43 this year so I hadn't had a mammogram yet. If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it. 2 months ago I saw that I had a bruise on my left breast that came out of nowhere. I know I hadn't bumped it or had one of my critters jump on it. I am notorious for having random bruises though and didn't think too much of it at the time. I checked it again after almost a week and the bruise hadn't changed in any way. That's when I started feeling around on it. Directly below it was a hard lump. I told my husband (he's a nurse) the next day when he got home. We both felt it and knew it needed checking.

Due to Covid and crippling social anxiety it took me two months to get an appointment with my GP to get a referral for a mammogram. That was 2 weeks ago. During that exam by her she found a second small lump in my right breast. During the 2 month time period between finding the lump and seeing my doctor, I started to have increasing soreness and pain in my left chest/breast and down my arm. I do have angina, but this was different. The place that the pain was in was more my chest wall than interior in my chest. My GP scheduled me for a mammogram and sonogram ASAP, and referred me to a breast specialist/oncologist.

That was done last week. The right lump is small with diffuse edges and the radiologist said it's a 50% chance that it is a growth of some kind. The left lump is very large, very dense, and has sharp edges in a cauliflower like pattern. The ultrsonographers and the radiologists faces were grim when looking at it. He said he gives me an almost 100% chance that it is a tumor. They said I needed a biopsy ASAP. I already had a follow up appointment scheduled with the specialist for tomorrow. Since my appointment last week I have been called by all 3 places about getting the biopsy done as soon as possible. So I see the specialist tomorrow and have the biopsy scheduled at her surgery center for right afterwards.

I'm not going to lie, I am scared. I am almost positive that it is going to be malignant. I have relatives on both sides of my family that had breast cancer. I know that my mom's Aunt died from it. My mother had uterine cancer when she was about my age. She also had at least one benign breast tumor. 

I don't really have much family support. Both my mother and both husband's parents have passed. My dad remarried only 4 months after my mother passed. He has since alienated me for various reasons. One of which being that he continues to hold parties for all of my stepmother's family during covid. So I'm honestly scared to be around him because I can't afford to get it. I already almost died from bronchitis once when I went into septic shock. I am also disabled due to multiple car accidents effing up my back pretty badly. So I'm not able to do much or go out much. 

The one great shining light is my husband. He is the best support anyone could ask for. He is very stoic and doesn't show fear or hurt very much. He is ex military so fear is a weakness, lol! He also works 60 hours a week just to support us, so I don't have as much time with him as I would like. I know that he is scared out of his mind too. We are only going on our 10 year anniversary being together this year. Without him, I don't know how I would be right now. 
 
I apologize for the length of this. I just needed a place to tell the story and hopefully get some ideas of how to go about navigating this. Thank you for reading this."

I was diagnosed in March with stage 1. I have opted for double mastectomy with reconstruction due to family history. It has been an absolute nightmare trying to coordinate with an medical oncologist, oncologist surgeon and reconstructive surgeon. Covid isn’t making this any easier or faster to get treatment. I’m a nervous wreck. If I like them they’re not in my network and the ones that are seem to be bottom of the barrel. Here’s my question ladies &amp; gents my insurance isn’t the best, I’ve chosen to go thru a private insurance who accepts pre existing conditions and switch. Of course it’s costing an arm and a leg but I’m lucky enough to have that option. It’s a PPO( I think that’s what they called it) so I will be able to choose my drs etc. I should most likely have an answer within 24 hrs according to representative. Before I sign and cancel existing insurance what questions would you suggest I ask? This is the first time/year I’ve ever had insurance so I’d like to make sure I go over all important questions before signing anything. If this isn’t the right sub apologies, please redirect me."

I am BRCA negative, but still family history is a cause of concern - mother and her twin in their early 40s. I’m 43. My specialist talked to me about Tamoxifen for 5 years as a preventative. Has anyone had any experience with this as a preventative? Seems like the side effects can be pretty bad, but was told it could cut my risk by 50%. I’m trying to weigh my options - I feel like calling them options is a poor choice of words, but not sure how else to put it. I don’t know mgs or anything - just doing my due diligence so I feel I’m making an informed decision.

Rebbenav,1594663782,"I hope this is allowed. I didnt know where else to look given the current situation.

My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in March just as our state implemented a lockdown. Thankfully she was able to have surgery and tomorrow is supposed to be her last radiation treatment. But we haven't really been able to be with her during this time for her safety (COVID-19). I know she feels a bit sad about this even though my sisters and I call her daily and bring over meals. 

I wanted to do something for her tomorrow when she finished her treatment. I was thinking of being outside the Dr. office with posters, ballons, and flowers. My question is if this is a good and safe idea, or if you might have any suggestions. I have already mentioned to her a celebration dinner later when she's feeling better and we can be extra cautious.

Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. Thanks."
MaryjaneFelder,1594652432,"Hi. New to posting on Reddit so please forgive any mistakes. Sorry for wall of text, but idk where else to rant.

Round 1: I'm mid 50s, first round with Breast cancer in 2000 in my 30s. Tiny, smaller then a pea. Surgery and radiation, after 15 yrs of annual check ups I was told not to worry about it I'm considered 'cured'. 

Round 2: Last year I found a huge tumor on the opposite side, about 6 cm. Mammogram and ultrasound found 2 more deep in ducts on the original side, too deep to feel. 3 tumors, 2 different types of cancer. I opted for a complete double mastectomy. I was supposed to do chemo with doxorubicin and one other drug I don't recall. I had no one to talk to beyond research online. No support groups, therapy, nothing. I felt like a sheep being shoved down the chute towards the slaughter house, ' this is what you're doing and right now and no other options'. When I mentioned anything to the surgeon he made jokes about ""Dr Google"". I don't use that search, I do very good research and just wanted him to listen. Between being scared and bullied I bailed on treatments. Figured I'd be ok cuz the surgeon got clear margins. No reconstruction.

Round 3: Just had surgery last week to remove a 2 cm tumor that popped up out of nowhere on the original side. This one invasive (no breast tissue there for it to grow). They want to put me through the whole thing, chemo, radiation, the works. Terrified doesn't begin to describe how I feel.

I finally got a therapist and she listens to me. They've got me on mood stabilizer and Valium because my panic attacks could be measured on the Richter scale without them. Doesn't stop them, but they're not as bad. 

To have this happen during the Covid pandemic isn't helping.

I feel so alone. Like I'm the only one that cares if I make it or not, least at home. My youngest (26M) tries, my oldest (30M)"
mermaidmu,1594651634,"I'm not sure how to process all of this.

Back in January, my dr found a lump during my annual exam. I'm 37 so no mammos yet. We did mammogram, ultrasound and they found 2 lumps, both oval in shape and I can feel one of them. They said for my sanity, they'd do biopsy on the larger one and results came back as fibroadinoma. (I probably spelled that wrong). Set up follow up for 6 months to make sure the smaller one hadn't grown or changed. They assumed since larger one was benign that smaller one would be as well.

Fast forward to last Thursday, went for my follow up and was completely non-phased. Assumed everything was fine since earlier indications were that everything was fine. 

Near the smaller fibroadenoma, they found something that almost looks like cauliflower. Really the best description I can find. Definitely not the same shape as the fibroadenoma, not smooth. I can't find it on myself to know what it feels like. I had no idea anything had changed. 

So now I'll have my second biopsy on Wednesday and will get my results Friday at 2:15. I think because I went in with the idea that everything was fine and then it wasn't that I have myself freaked out even more than I was in January. There was no question, no debate, no we think it's fine but we're going to check just to be sure like there was in January...it was, we need to get this biopsied as soon as we can. 

I guess my main question and wondering if anyone has ever had this experience of having fibroadenomas and then later finding something more sinister. I was assured they'd never grow into cancer, but this is also not attached to either of the other ones, it's just kind of beside the smaller growth. 

I'm hoping I'm being silly but I went ahead and got myself some life insurance (which I should have done after my initial scare) and I'm just anxious and trying to be productive this week although I'm having a hard time concentrating on literally anything else. 

Anyone deal with something similar? Thanks for your responses. It's hard being optimistic when I'm terrified."
dble1224,1594647621,"Hi all,

I am trying to prep for an upcoming double mastectomy.  What’s your favorite compression bra post-surgery?"
tankengine69,1594592101," 

1. Who gets cancer?

Anyone can get cancer, although the risk goes up with age. Your individual risk depends on factors such as whether you smoke, lifestyle choices such as what you eat and how much you exercise, your family history of cancer, and factors in your workplace and environment.

2. How does cancer start?

Your body is made up of many different types of cells. Under normal conditions, cells grow, divide, become old, and die. Then, in most cases, they’re replaced by new cells. But sometimes cells mutate grow out of control, and form a mass, or tumor, instead of dying.

Tumors can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Cancerous tumors can attack and kill your body’s tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body, causing new tumors to form there. This process is called metastasis and it represents cancer that has advanced to a late stage.

3. Is cancer genetic?

Cancer is, in fact, a genetic disease. This is because cancer is caused by mutations or changes to genes that control the way our cells function, causing them to behave irregularly. These mutations can be inherited, as they are in about 5-10 percent of all cancer cases, but it’s much more likely that these gene changes occur during a person’s lifetime due to other factors besides genetics.

When someone has a known family history of hereditary cancer, genetic testing is often recommended.

4.Is cancer contagious?

No. Cancer isn’t like the flu or a cold. You can’t catch cancer from someone who has the disease.

5. Is there a vaccine for cancer?

There is no vaccine for cancer. But there are vaccines for some viruses that are known to cause cancer, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B.

HPV can cause cancer and getting vaccinated against it can help protect against the types of HPV that can lead to cervical, anal, throat, and penile cancers, along with some other forms of cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against many strains of the virus that can cause these cancers.

The same is true for infection with the hepatitis B virus, which has been linked to liver cancer. Getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk for getting liver cancer. But just like the HPV vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine doesn’t protect against liver cancer itself. It only protects against the virus that might lead to liver cancer.

losingmymind82,1594573916,"So, I am recently diagnosed with DCIS at 36 years old.  I am in the process of waiting for genetic testing. My mother has had DCIS twice now, once in each breast. She has also had a carcinoma. My doctors are pushing me to do the lumpectomy and radiation now, which I’m hesitant to do. I don’t want to potentially set myself up for 2 surgeries should the genetic testing indicate a mastectomy would be best. Also, I know of 2 women who did the lumpectomy and radiation. They both had a recurrence in the same breast years later, and had to get a mastectomy. Both of these women aren’t able to have reconstruction done due to damage to their skin from the previous radiation. Is this a more common thing or rare? If I was to ever have a recurrence I would absolutely want reconstruction, and this is really holding me back from doing the lumpectomy/radiation. My current oncologist just kind of acknowledged that can happen, and started talking about the lumpectomy again. I have an appointment set for the 20th for a second opinion at one of the best cancer centers in my area. But I wanted to hear from people who have maybe been down this road, as I’m finding doctors sometimes downplay my concerns."
Avocationist,1594572852,"I had my lupectomy on Thursday. My surgeon came in to talk to me beforehand, and she told me, I usually take only one or two nodes. If (something I don't remember), I'll take three, but I never remove more than four. 

Then at the end of the surgical procedure, when I was still in an anesthesia fog, I remember her saying, ""I had to take four nodes."" 

I'm not worried. I just wish I knew why she might have removed four when she didn't expect to remove more than two. Any thoughts as to why?"
mrsj123,1594571747,"I found my knot when I was 29. I had a husband and 3 kids, 2 under the age of 5. I was told not to worry about the knot that it was a cyst, but my guts told me to push the issue. They did a biopsy. A week later I was told it was cancer. I did a lumpectomy. Then my chemo got delayed due to the dr not filing my paperwork. The dr apologized to me he said based on my age and no family history he just assumed it was nothing. I did chemo and radiation. Then 2 yrs later a hysterectomy. My latest mamo came back good. 
Now I'm having joint issues,my legs look like purple spiderwebs,  fatigue, swelling joints, among other things. I was told to see a rheumatologist. We talked but I felt she wasn't really listening. She ran test to see if it's an autoimmune disease or something. I go back Wednesday to get results. I'm afraid I'll be dismissed again and told it's nothing. When I know my body-something is going on! Ever since the bc and being dismissed I hate going to the dr! 
When a close family member found out I had cancer. She called everyone. I was pissed bc I wasn't ready to share the news. I had estranged family calling me and messaging me not to show concern. Then when the genetic test showed it's not genetic (no surprise-there's no family history of it) they all stopped speaking to me. That's ok I'm better off they can keep their ""thoughts and prayers"". Well now the gossiping family member is trying to dig info out of me about what's going on. She knows something is going on. I mean I can't hide my legs it's too hot for pants. It's like she wants something to be wrong with me so she can tell people and they'll feel sorry for her. I would like to share my health problems with her but I can't trust her and dont want her 2 cents on my health. Plus I dont want a repeat of her gossiping again. There's no talking civil to her and explaining why I don't want my business out there. She doesn't understand. I know I don't have to tell her jack shit if I don't want to but she's just gonna keep digging till she gets what she wants."
Andreas1237,1594563184,"Hello everybody! 

I am currently writing my MSc thesis about home monitoring of cancer patients. The goal is to investigate whether it could improve the quality of life for cancer patients if certain check-ups or tests could be done at home instead of the hospital. This could potentially help chemotherapy patients to leave the hospital more quickly and reduce the number of hospital visits overall. 

It would be extremely helpful to know the views of cancer patients. It is not important whether you have been undergoing chemotherapy or not. 

The survey takes about 10 minutes and I really appreciate every person who takes part in it!

yamsnz,1594561565,"I’ve been lurking here for a few weeks trying to prepare myself for what to expect at the breast clinic appointment tomorrow.

I’m 28f with a family history of breast cancer.

Been to the doctors about 12 times in the last year for left side chest and back pain, it started off between my shoulder blades and tingling - each time I got a random diagnosis- shingles (with no rash), nerve pain, back strain and a bunch of others including “it’s just anxiety”.

About 4 months ago my left breast started hurting a lot too, and I noticed a large lump in my armpit on the same side. The doctor finally felt it and referred me to be seen at the breast clinic. 

I had normal blood tests and a normal chest X-ray but I’m unsure if those things matter with breast cancer. 

I’m very worried as since my referral the lump is now a lot bigger and my left arm is so sore I can hardly move it - I’m very worried it’s something bad and it’s spread to the bone. Left arm is so weak I can’t even squeeze the toothpaste with it. 

Anyone want to tell me what I should expect tomorrow? I’m assuming a mammogram but will that show what’s going on under my arm?

The asymmetry was never really noticeable until now though. In the past couple of days, I've noticed that that difference has significantly increased very suddenly.

I don't know if this is important, but I am supposed to get my period in a few days. I've never experienced any breast tenderness or boob enlargement/shrinkage due to my period though.

The past couple of days has been very nerve wracking on me, just the idea of not knowing. I am sure many people on this understand that feeling.  As usual , my analytical self is thinking about all the different possibilities. Some of the thoughts that went through my mind were perspective and how it changed despite technically at the moment I am not diagnosed.

The idea of ""live your life like each day is it's last"" was something that came up while i was reflecting/panicking. Regardless of whether or not I get diagnosed, this little scare really put things into perspective that your life can change in an instant. I know it has been said all the time, but really it is hard to actualize what that means until you are potentially looking at death's door.

forteamtang-,1594349895,"I am a 29M.  


I recently was at the gym and was exercising. When perfoming a bench press, the bar had hit my nipple ( i would say rather hard?). Normally there is no problems, but it felt a little tender. I brushed it off.  I figure i might have caused some trauma , and maybe one of the pores got clogged or something.   


A few days laters i went again to the gym , and as luck would have it is i hit it my nipple again ( skill of course) and it was tender again. wtf?  I go home and and palpate and feel a little lump during on the bottom part of my areola (still on my nipple).  It does not hurt or anything, but it feels kind of tender with blunt pressure to it ( like with a barbell smashing it ) or i also noticed that i can get to feel tender if i kind of brush my hands back and forth over my nipple where the lump is. As soon as i stop, everything subsides. It feels kind of soft lump that feels almost like a pea, and no pain when i put direct pressure on it.  I palpate around the lump, around the breast tissue and there is no problems of sensitivity or tenderness anywhere else. There is no discoloration or discharge or anything like that. I have been keeping track of it, and the lump is about the same size (after 1 week).   


I know coming to reddit for a diagnosis is dumb. But i am kind of dealing with anxiety about it :( so I was hoping maybe some of the members can share their experience when it comes to the money side of it.    
stuff like the cost to check it out. mammogram ? ultrasound?   
In the case that it is cancer, how much were treatments for surgery or medication for chemo or radiations.   


i am trying to figure out that if i get a short term insurance if it will cover me. and assuming that the insurance covers me , will i be screwed for getting a more long term insurance at a later date if i have a ""pre existing condition""."

timsmithismyrealname,1594336108,"Hi Guys,

I am trying to get honest feedback re: where my mom is at with her health with stage four metastatic cancer.  I know that I need to take it day by day, but I also feel totally at a lose in terms of how severe her cancer is and how imminent her death may be. 

My mom had metastatic breast cancer 2 - but when they took the tumor out surrounding, it was HR+. The latter one gave her the metastasis that has spread to her brain. She was diagnosed with stage four about four years ago, and I am having a hard time getting information from her in terms of where she's at with her health. Some days she's fine and says stuff along the lines of:  ""I can't wait to take care of your grandkids."" Other days, like after a fight with my dad,  she cries and says ""no one cares that I'm dying."" She is very sensitive and anxious, with a history of panic disorder, but is also extremely stubborn, resilient, and protective. I have a hard time knowing when she is putting on a brave face to stay positive, and when she suffering. 

For the most part she SEEMS fine, but it is typical for her to get bad nose bleeds, hit by a wave of fatigue, or the sudden sensation of not being able to feel her hand. She can snap out of it with such enthusiasm that I believe her when she says ""oh it's just a side effect of the medication, no biggie.""  She has gone through chemo and is now getting infusions weekly. I love her immensely but her emotional consistencies and moods swings have made it hard for me to read her feelings for my whole life. Now that she is sick and sometimes on meds like steroids  etc, her mood swings are much, much worse.  

  
I don't know how to have this conversation with her without feeling deceived or lied to - obviously there's a lot going on emotionally, but I am also used to not getting the truth in full from her. One time she got so upset about I can't even remember what and she shouted ""you gave me cancer.""  More often she says I am singlehandedly the reason she can push forward, and that doctors are totally stunned and amazed by the results of her clinical trial.  She didn't tell me she had cancer for a full year while I was in college, and for two years made me promise not to tell anyone. My dad is evasive and when I ask him about it he gets overly philosophical and then starts to cry. Still, he is mostly tapped out which makes it hard for me to gauge whether or not he's not taking it seriously, or is so emotionally repressed/overwhelmed that he simply can't discuss it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm asking/hoping someone can objectively break down what is going on. Someone who is informed. Ideally I could speak with her doctor directly, but I honestly don't know how to broach that topic with her, and I'm not sure if they'll disclose that information to me either way? I'm sure there are tools/ways that I can communicate with her more effectively. I know it's unrealistic for me to be like ""how long do you think she has?"" but I also want to plan accordingly, be prepared, and feel like I have a grip on the gravity of the situation."
catsgotcats,1594327199,"Might be a silly post but figured I’d ask. Last year about this time I noticed a single dimple in my right breast at about 7o’clock. It looks like my boob is sucked in in one spot when I lean forward or am on my hands and knees. 
I took a picture and showed my PCP, who said it was nothing to worry about as I’m 24.
I went to the breast cancer center anyways. They saw me and did a breast exam and told me to come back in 6 months. After 6 months I came back, and they noticed the dent and gave me an ultrasound. They didn’t see anything concerning in the ultrasound, nor did they feel any lump. Since then I had another breast exam at my obgyn.
Is this kind of dent normal? Everyone seems to shrug it off but I’ve received no explanation or reason for why it’s there. Seems like I shouldn’t worry about it after having four doctors and an ultrasound say it’s nothing but I have dense DDD’s and worry they just didn’t feel it."

Well 4 days after THAT, the lumpiness and bruises are gone ...and I found this pea sized lump ...in a different area, of the same breast.  

 The pea-sized lump feels smooth and hard, and does NOT move, and feels close to the surface. Like you don’t have to DIG for it, you can gently rub your finger across the skin and feel it. It’s not a pimple, it’s not red, no rash, no discharge.

I'm 30 years old (almost 31). For the last couple years, I've been getting bi-yearly breast ultrasounds, because I learned that I have a strong family history and I have fibrocystic breasts that cause lumpiness. Normally I live overseas, but in March I came to the USA to say goodbye to a dying grandparent, and two days later all borders and flights vanished before my eyes. I don't have health insurance. Everything is incredibly stressful.

Around that time, I found an indent (actually two) in my breast, but only when I push in. There is a chance this is nothing. There is a chance that cysts, or something benign could cause this symptom. But you know what I can't do? I can't get my normal ultrasound. For weeks things were shut down. I'm about to go broke because I can't work and unemployment insurance doesn't fucking care. I feel sick just thinking about it. The fear and stress are immense. And hopefully, HOPEFULLY this month I'll maybe be able to borrow money so I can get a doctor's appointment and then get approved for an ultrasound. My last couple were clean, and that's what I'm holding on to... that maybe this is nothing. But it's hard to ignore.

Back home, I don't need a doctor evaluation, and I have insurance, and I know what everything costs and my doctors and I run things very smoothly every six months... such is not the case in the world of covid. I want to cry all the fucking time. I miss my home and my significant other so much it physically hurts, and on top of it, I'm still worried about the virus itself. Google doesn't help and almost exclusively talks about what is/could be cancer, and less about the possible benign issues. I've been using iodine drops, I don't drink or take birth control, I exercise regularly. I'm on the young side. So I'm trying to stay calm, but this has been my reality since fucking March. In the normal world, I would have had a check up in June. I didn't have access to a car, I don't have access to health care STILL, I'm just a sitting duck and all I want is to be able to get my regular ultrasound to try to find some peace of mind.

They called today to say the right breast and armpit are fine. The lump in the left breast is invasive ductal breast cancer. 

I’ve had the lump for a few months, and recently had a baby, so I was very much hoping it was a clogged duct or something that would resolve on its own. 

The size is about 2cm. They weren’t able to say the stage or much other specifics. I have an appointment on Thursday with a surgeon to review this and go over a treatment plan. 

I’m still processing the news.

My sister's in law was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. She is 28 and was 6 months pregnant when diagnosed. ER 10% postive, PR -, HER2 -. There is debate whether she is TNbC or ER+. Anyway..
They started chemo first - 4 rounds of AC and then half dose Taxol until delivery. She got 2 half doses of Taxol before her delivery. She delivered a healthy baby girl on 21st May. 

There was a gap of a month between her Taxol chemo ( stopped 2 weeks before delivery and 2 weeks after) Ultrasound revealed that tumor which shrunk to 3cm was now back to 3.2 cm. Doc got concerned and suggested emergency bilateral Mastectomy. Doc said she couldn't get reconstruction right away because of COVID ( difficult to get plastic surgeon at such short notice) and also that radiation might further cause issues. 
Any comments and thoughts on treatment are most welcome. 

Okay so If that wasn't enough, my brother, (a software engineer) lost his job on 1 July (my sister in law's Birthday). And all of the attention is to to now to help him find a job as his Canada work visa + sis insurance depends on that. 

But I don't want her to not feel like we aren't there for her...so want to do something for her. she is now hating her body and thinks she looks like a boy or worse.  I ordered cute dresses for her postpartum size and want to order some mastectomy related stuff too.. the problem is I am not finding anything on Amazon Canada. Mostly the stuff is for women with reconstruction. 

I want to know if it's appropriate to send someone prosthetic stuff..she isn't buying because it is expensive and wants to delay. I am not sure how she'll feel of I order.
Also, are there any other organisations which may provide support to women with breast cancer with stuff at a subsidized cost?"
ScaredHubby2020,1593976275,"Hello, my wife (43f) was just diagnosed with breast cancer. We're in the early stages of the process. Started with a screening mamo, which saw calcifications, which lead to diagnostic mamo + sonogram, which led to needle biopsy, which led to lumpectomy. 

Best we know right now is that it's likely DCIS (phew), but there is potential evidence of ""microinfiltrations"". We're in Pittsburgh (UPMC), and the pathologist at the satellite hospital we used wasn't sure. Because of that, the entire pathology team at Mcgee women's in Pittsburgh is looking over it, and she also just had an MRI. 

We know it's er+ pr+, but they don't test for HER2-. 

We also know it's Grade 2 - but we were told Grade 2 is much closer to Grade 1 than Grade 3, so I guess that's good? 

MRI results are expected Wednesday, although pathology might be more than another week. 

So the surgical oncologist thinks it's likely Stage 0 or very early Stage 1. And, if that's the case, that's great news. But I'm terrified that so far, every time they've said ""well, it's only a 10% chance it's more"", we've hit that 10% chance. And the next 10% chance is that it's in her nodes. 

I \*really\* think this got caught early. Her previous screening mamo was 3 years prior, so that's the gap we're looking at. But, I'm doing everything I can to be strong for her, to tell her it'll all be OK, that we've caught it early, that this is the best possible outcome.

But I'm freaking out and I can't show that to her - so I'm posting here. I know statistics, and I know everything is on our side right now. But it's hard not to wake up at 4AM, wondering if it's spread everywhere and we just don't know yet. 

I know there are so many people on here with ""worse"" diagnoses, and are doing well, and being strong. I'm trying my best, and I'm trying not to be a burden on anyone in our life right now, since the focus has to be on my wife and I want to do everything I can to support her. So I ended up here. 

Thanks for listening."
Jtrem714,1593975299,"Originally, posted about my wife's diagnoses here back in January. 

The initial scans showed that she had 3 suspected lymph nodes (Both via PET/CT and Ultrasound) The Main mass was biopsied and was high-grade Triple negative. However, no biopsy on the nodes. 

After 6 founds of AC chemo with Taxotere. 

She underwent a Single Mastectomy with Sentinel node biopsy.

Good news all 4 nodes removed during the surgery were negative. However, the main mass remained at the same size 4cm total. 

The surgeon was able to get clear margins all the way around. No impact on chest wall muscle what so ever. 

Now here is where we are getting the confusion. The oncologist isn't recommending Radiation. Since there is no impact on the nodes according to the biopsy during the mastectomy. 

However, we had a consultation with the Radiation Oncologist and they are pushing to do radiation given that they suspected impact on the lymph nodes during the initial diagnoses and the fact that the main tumor still remained and was high grade. 

Anything, I have researched showed no benefits with doing radiation on node-negative mastectomy with a tumor under 5cm total and with clear margins. 

In this case who wins out? My wife and I are confused and wondering if we should seek another opinion on the matter with another Radiation Oncologist."
Andreas1237,1593961406,"  Hello everybody! 

I am currently writing my MSc thesis about home monitoring of cancer patients. The goal is to investigate whether it could improve the quality of life for cancer patients if certain check-ups or tests could be done at home instead of the hospital. This could potentially help chemotherapy patients to leave the hospital more quickly and reduce the number of hospital visits overall. 

It would be extremely helpful to know the views of cancer patients. It is not important whether you have been undergoing chemotherapy or not. 

The survey takes about 10 minutes and I really appreciate every person who takes part in it!

GraceNeededDaily,1593879813,Hello everyone. I'm (45f) newly diagnosed and just starting my journey. Stage 2 grade 2 er+pr+ her2- IDC. I think that's all correct. Everyone in the Cancer center so far has agreed that there's no better outcomes between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. But I see so many people opting for mastectomy on here even when it's their option. So I'm finding it hard to believe that there isn't some benefit to it but I don't know what that is.  Can anyone tell me why one would opt for a mastectomy over a lumpectomy?  And also why do doctors tell us there's no difference if there is?  Or is it just my doctor? I'm kind of leaning toward mastectomy because I have young children and I want to give myself the best chance to be around until they are adults. But if there's no benefit to it it's also a lot bigger of a deal now.  Tia
Stan4Live,1593879277,"My (33m) lovely wife (35f) has finally been diagnosed.

Stage 1 or 2 IDC / Grade 1 er+ pr+ her2-

The stage can't be confirmed since the tumour is 21 MM and they wont confirm her nodes are clear until after surgery. She had a second biopsy of the nodes and the radiologist is confident there is no issue there. Crossing are fingers.

A lumpectomy is 4 to 6 weeks from now. Covid delays. Surgery will be followed by radiation and hormone therapy 5 years. This can also change if she is gene positive. Then it's a mastectomy.

Either way she probably wants to get the mastectomy since she's young and wants to get as far away from a recurrence as possible. Also, the boob job lol. She's always wanted one, and it would be free. I find that weird ! But if the idea makes her happy, Im happy. We will also have to talk to a fertility clinic about freezing some eggs...I assume that will also be covered.

Im worried about the surgery being in so long. She was told that the cancer is slow moving and the delay wont change anything. Still, I cant help but feel paranoid that this is all due to Covid and we wont be getting the level of treatment she deserves.

We will be exploring second opinions. Another teaching hospital and the private sector.

FantasyDogPack,1593875668,"I had the last of 7 rounds of chemo on 4 July 2013. It always tickled me that it was Independence Day. I was 45 with a 14 year old daughter when I was diagnosed earlier that year with Stage 3. I had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. Luckily the cancer responded really well to chemo and the lump shrank so much that there was a real comedy moment at my oncologist appointment when he couldn't actually find the lump anymore.

Since then I've had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction and my ovaries removed as genetic testing showed I had a virulent form of the Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1 mutation; without the surgery I'd have had an 80% chance of getting breast cancer again or ovarian cancer. There was no family history as my four older sisters are clear of the gene and my father (the gene carrier) was adopted and all we know about his birth family was that his father was a Polish Jew. 

I have been incredibly lucky: I am completely well; I have an amazing family; and thank goodness for genetic testing, it saved my life. I also got married again 3 weeks after the end of chemo and that was the best decision I've ever made and heaven knows I've made some bad ones (eg the two previous husbands)!

Azealia_Wanks,1593873079,"Hi all! Posting because I (25F) am very concerned about some changes in my left breast. 

I noticed a few weeks ago that my left breast has started to get very saggy — much saggier than my right. The nipple has become swollen and puffy, and the glands on my areola are looking darker and bigger. I shrugged these off, suspecting they were linked to hormonal changes and possibly an increase in the amount of exercise (including weightlifting for arms and pecs) that I've been doing.

However, I've just noticed some blue/purple discolouration underneath the swollen nipple. It feels kind of tender when I touch it — perhaps even a slight stinging sensation. The skin doesn't feel completely smooth — it feels a bit like when you run your fingers over stretch marks. The nipple is looking quite dark, and when it puckers up the skin becomes much harder and much wrinklier than my other nipple.

I'm booking a GP appointment as soon as I can, but in the meantime, I wanted to know if those symptoms are familiar to anyone who has an experience with cancer? Thanks so much for your advice/responses."
anonymous420223,1593839468,"TLDR: I am overreacting about a lump. Telling random internet strangers might help calm me down until my appointment. 

I noticed my breasts were quite swollen and very painful. I had to dig out an old DD bra (C is normal) and the sudden change in breast size without any associated weight gain is weird. I thought it was related to my cycle or hormones. Upon further inspection I noticed a good sized lump in my right breast in the axillary region that has distinct margins and is firm. I had an appointment with my OBGYN already scheduled for 3 days after I found the lump thankfully. 

I have an extended family history on both sides...I am freaking out. I don't want to tell anyone besides my husband because I don't know anything yet. Also, so many people are already at their wits end with COVID, I don't want to pile on for no reason. I have been scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram but the earliest they can get me in is July 16th. If I tell my mom she will probably drop everything and move across the country to take care of me. I tried to do the same when she was diagnosed but she wouldn't let me leave my job at the start of my career. My rational brain tells me that it's probably just a fibroadenoma but my irrational brain screams you are going to die of cancer!! 

None of my family members have died of breast cancer or complications from it so really it's not rational to think I will. I am fine and feeling good until suddenly I am curled up in a ball crying. If I knew one way or the other I could relax either with a plan or a cocktail but knowing me both. The uncertainty is really driving my stress levels through the roof."

Hello. Imma 30yr old AA female. For the last couple months I’ve been having breast pain and on &amp; off slight itching in the inner left breast. I’ve had an ultrasound (deemed too young for a mammogram) and a negative bilateral MRI. Is it possible that something was missed. I must admit I do have health anxiety. I’ve also read up on IBC and know that it does not present with a lump. Would it show on MRI imaging? I’m afraid that something was missed and I’ll end up stage 4 and terminal. I’ve also been having some back pain which is adding to the anxiety"

Did anyone experience breast tissue left behind after mastectomy. I am curious as I have been experiencing pain in my reconstructed breasts just before my periods. It lasts for a week or 2. Is this because of tissue left behind? 
Also, I am premenopausal and still undecided about Tamoxifen. Any advice as my oncologist suggests that this will drop estrogen esp if any residual tissue is present. I have done MRI but not conclusive. Its been a year and half now since the mastectomy and reconstruction.
Thank you."

throwawycove,1593790487,"just a couple questions/maybe some reassurance

about 6 weeks ago I started losing weight, and noticed maybe a lump around 12/1 o'clock and slight changes in my breasts, I equated this to the weight loss and maybe my body finally getting over breastfeeding (a year ago this month I stopped) kinda kept an eye on it and this past week I noticed severe nipple indentation and what I would describe as a valley looking shape (my nipple being the lowest part, left tissue peaking higher than right) and some discharge similar to a brown colostrum. I've contacted doctors and got a req for an ultrasound, I should hear back from the cancer screening clinic with an appointment date early next week. Just wondering if anyone who's experienced a breast ultrasound could tell me what to expect in terms of going forward and who I would hear from/ how long afterwards etc.

Icooktoo,1593634251,"Just came from my oncologist appointment. It was a follow up to a gene test on the tumor and results of the pet scan. The pet scan says there is no visible cancer. The EPclin risk score is 3.7. High risk (barely) of the cancer showing up somewhere else within the next 10 years. The oncologist has recommended 4 months of chemo and did not specify which but did mention transfusions? He said the other option is an estrogen blocker for 10 years. He wants to start right away. I am about two weeks from getting tissue expanders out and implants in. I want to wait till that surgery is done to start chemo. I'm not taking an estrogen blocker for 10 years. I already have some pretty heavy hot flashes and night sweats and have for 20 years. Make it worse for 10 years? I don't think so.

She's had an ultra sound, a biopsy of the lump and biopsy of a swollen lymph node. 

Now we are waiting for see the surgeon, but her GP seems to be saying early stage 1 maybe ? But can't be sure. Treatment is a lumpectomy and maybe radiation. No mention of hormone therapy. 

The doctor who performed the biopsy initially said he would be surprised if it was cancer and he is not concerned with the lymph node ? 

These details sound a little vague to us. She has a palpable lump. She got the ultrasound 4 weeks ago and biopsy 2 weeks ago and there seems to be absolutely no urgency in any of this. 

How could her GP have no information for us other than cancer and lumpectomy ? We asked about the lymph node biopsy and got back that it was unremarkable. She also stressed that there is no need for a mastectomy or chemo, how can she possibly know this but have no details about the type of cancer for us. 

A biopsy and ultrasound was done...Shouldn't we have some idea of what's going on ? 

Anyways, the waiting sucks. Meeting with surgeon Friday...Limbo until then, if anyone has any advice for us...that be great."

FathersChild,1593424998,"I have noticed that during the talks with the doctors and also in this sub there is a focus on the possible negative side effects of treatment. While I think it is important to inform about them and how to cope with them, I also realised that it gives patients and their relatives a biased impression on what to expect during treatment. As if everything was miserable 24/7 from now on for everyone.

I don't want to downplay the negative sides. But being in the middle of treatment (lumpectomy and chemotherapy done, radiation and tamoxifen ahead) I've learned that it helps me to cope with negative side effects and feelings like anger or fear to make myself aware of the positive things, even when they seem small and void.

Hence, I think we should collect some positive aspects, I'd love to read yours! Here are mine (so far):

* I've happily learned that some friends are true friends being very supportive. I was in hospital for two nights only, but the've visited me so often that I couldn't even finish watching a single film - I was always busy. They still keep me busy now, with regular walks/small bike tours, joined me to the appointment where doctors discussed the therapy with me to make sure I get things right, escort me to my chemo-appointments, made me a care package, they do the grocery shopping during covid, they ask about my treatment and don't get tired to listen .... I just love them!
* I've always had long thick hair and never tried a shorter hairstyle because I was afraid it might look bad and then it take to long to grow it back to something I like better. Knowing I would get bald during chemo I took the opportunity to try shorter hair styles. Firstly, to stepwise get used to shorter hair, but also see what might look good.  So I wore my hair at shoulder length for some days, ear length, with an undercut, a pixie... Some looked good, some awful, and I've made a selfie collection to help me decide which length I want to have once the hair grows back.
* I've learned that I have a nice head shape and could totally wear a pixie if I wanted to.
* I've met lovely women while getting chemotherapy. All with a breast cancer diagnosis. Some with a better, others with a worse prognosis. Some had to fight a recurrance. Some with young kids to care for. And most of them just lovely, dignified and strong. It was nice to share experiences, give each other tipps, compliment each other and to have the feeling we're all in the same team fighting the enemy. 
* Only during chemo I realised that ""loosing hair"" is not only about scalp hair, but body hair as well. And while loosing eye brows and lashes is strange and annoying (when they fell in the eyes) - I didn't had to depilate unwanted body hair for months - Usually, I have long dark hair almost everywhere and it's painful to get rid of it - now there's almost no hair at the legs, none at the chest or belly and the smoothest chin since I was a kid :)
* I was told to protect my nails from UV with dark nail polish during chemo with taxol. Since I usually only wear light colours or no polish at all to not stand out, I took the opportunity. Chose my favourite colours in dark red, even learned how to do two-coloured polish and am glad that it covers the currently ugly nails perfectly.
* Being someone who used to have difficulties to reject other people's requests and thus overloading myself - I (secretly) enjoy that I can honestly say when I don't feel like doing XY and learn that people are ok with it. No further pressuring from their side, no guilty feelings from my side.
* I am taking more often the time to go outside and watch nature consciously. I take pictures of flowers or trees in the nearby gardens and parks. Watch the birds and insects, spot some mushrooms. Watch the seasonal changes. And whenever I'm stuck at home and feel bad (physically or emotionally) I scroll through the pictures and it really cheers me up.
* Speaking of nature: This was the first time for \~20 years that I didn't have to deal with my pollen allergy in spring and the cross sensitivity to certain fruits - thanks to dexamethasone that was given to me along with chemotherapy.
* I've learned how much certain music is soothing me. Only practising music distracted me from my fears while waiting for the biopsy results. Only listening to music in hospital calmed down my fears that I had in hospital while waiting for the surgery."
SuCoGoddess,1593411508,"My mother (65/F) is starting chemo tomorrow. She had a double mastectomy 6 months ago and the results came back from the lab that, even though she's cancer free right now, there's a 33% chance of it coming back. The cancer was extremely aggressive. It fed off of her estrogen.

I'm (34/F) an only child, parents divorced even I was 11, and my father died a few years back. My mother is all I have. She's my everything. My rock. My best friend. She's the best person I've ever known. Incredibly kind with an amazing personality. She's never experienced severe health problems or trauma in her life, so this being the first huge battle in life to have to face - it's not fair really.

Because of covid, nobody, except the patient, is allowed in the chemo room. So now she has to do it alone. That makes me very angry.

Sorry, I digress.

I know it's not about me, I understand that. I understand I'm not the one going through it but it does affect me. My mom made an appointment with a wig place and I told her to wait for me (we live an hour and a half away from each other). I wanted to share that experience with her. To have a positive experience with all of this. To laugh and giggle, trying on different wigs. Being a part of the process since I'm not allowed to be with her during the treatment.

She didn't wait for me. She went and bought a wig without me. I was so upset with her. She took the only positive I could have away from me. So now hell starts tomorrow and I'll be spending the next few days with her, taking care of her.

When I tried to explain why the wig was so important to me, she yelled at me and sarcastically said ""Yeah, it's all about you!"" I understand her emotions are all over the place, but I can't wrap my head around the fact that she looks at it like I'm being selfish. I'm most certainly not.

So now, for the next four months, all I'll be able to experience is the negative. Seeing my mother suffer, be miserable, lose all her hair, be sick and tired, seeing her with gray hair (when it comes back in). I've never seen her with gray hair in my life. My mother is going to change and I'm not ready. When I started noticing my mother begin to wrinkle, I lost it. (not in front of her of course).

I know this just isn't about a stupid wig, but that stupid wig was the most important part of this entire journey to me and she took it away from me.

I don't know if I'm even asking anything. Maybe I'm just venting."
bkr56,1593409461,"My grandma (85F) was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma last Wednesday.  The doctor has recommended a single mastectomy and lymphnode removal.  It’s been really tough to process this as I (29F) have a really special bond with her.  I view her as my mother more than my actual mother.  She is generally very healthy than most 80+ year olds, still mentally sharp and still physically in good shape for her age. She gardens everyday (1-3 hours) and used to go on daily walks pre-COVID. 

Older ladies who have had a mastectomy or know someone older who has had a mastectomy, how was the experience?  How was the recovery? 

I am so worried about how my grandma will tolerate this procedure due to her age.  She’s also sensitive to strong medications (prone to nausea/headaches) so I am worried that she won’t be able to tolerate the painkillers after the surgery.

When my tumor was originally identified on MRI, my first biopsy failed and required a second one. Fast forward...

I made an appointment today and the breast center is getting me in on Tuesday, but internally I'm a little freaked out. Has anyone else experienced anxiety when random things happen with your reconstructed breasts? They feel so foreign to me. It's hard for me to identify when it's appropriate to be worried or not.

foryourbreast,1593175776,"To increase the body's defenses, experts from the United States recommend that you include in your diet, as often as possible, foods rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such products will help to increase the resistance of immune cells, and prevent the development of cancer. Experts shared their conclusions on the pages of the publication [Clinical &amp; Experimental Metastasis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10585-018-9941-7).

According to scientists, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have a stimulating effect on the formation of T cells, thereby strengthening the immune system.

It is known that cancer cells that affect the breast have a high tendency to grow, as well as to spread to other organs. One of the main reasons for the development of breast cancer experts call a hormonal imbalance. The introduction of certain foods into the diet, changes in lifestyle and habits, help in reducing the risk of developing this pathology.

Experts from the University of Nebraska Medical center call eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids one of these remedies. In support of their words, they cited the results of an experiment conducted with laboratory rodents. Female mice that received omega-3 supplements were twice as likely to develop breast cancer cells as their control group counterparts. In addition, even in mice with breast cancer, there was almost no formation of metastases, and the survival rate among these rodents was higher.

In this regard, experts recommend introducing foods or supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids into the diet. These acids can also be recommended to reduce the number of complications in patients with breast cancer."

themostacceptable,1593169341,"This is mostly me crying/venting in a post, and a little bit the actual reason why I'm questioning it.


I'm 27 and was diagnosed last September with stage 2 triple positive IDC that spread to an axillar lymph node. I finished chemo in January, had a lumpectomy in February, completed 6 weeks of radiation, and am continuing Herceptin and Perjeta through September. My oncologist briefly brought up tamoxifen during my big diagnosis and treatment plan discussion, but just handed me a paper and said we'd talk about it when I finish chemo...then when I finished chemo she said when I finish radiation...then just prescribed it without discussing it. At the post chemo appointment, she said that because I have been so responsive to treatment, it may be overkill. I tried to discuss it with her but because of 'rona I wasn't able to see her and the nurse intercepted the call as usual. I told the nurse that I felt overwhelmed by the idea of the drug and that I didn't want to take it because five years makes me feel like I will never be ""me"" again, that I don't want more of a daily reminder, what the oncologist said, and that the doctor had also brought up the possibility that it could cause uterine cancer and if I were to get cancer again, I would rather deal with one I know. The nurse said ""themostacceptable, that's stupid"" (clearly very professional) and then told me the chances of uterine cancer (though she gave me the wrong statistics) and said it was ""stupid"" to risk my life because I don't want hot flashes (which i never mentioned being a reason). Oh, and she also told me it's going to be 10 years, not 5. Needless to say, I'm really hoping I never have to deal with her again.
Anyway, back to my point. Last week I saw the oncologist who asked how tamoxifen is going. I admitted I haven't started it yet. She told me because I'm so young with nothing in my genetic paneling, I have a high chance of recurrence and this is how to reduce that chance. ""Try it for a month and if you hate it, we'll discuss your options."" It came in the mail yesterday. I read the information packet unable to hold back tears. The clinical studies aspect makes to seem not worth it alone. 2000 with DCIS - 17/1000 for placebo had recurrence. 10/1000 for tamoxifen had recurrence. Also, it says in the packet there is no proven benefit for women under 35.


I don't know what's the right thing to do. I agreed to take it for a month. Do I do it, do I not, do I discuss it more with my oncologist, or do I get a second opinion? I worry that if I don't take it or get a second opinion, I will disappoint my oncologist (I see how ridiculous that is).

If you have taken it, what of the side effects have you dealt with? Does it get easier? How long have you been on it and have you had recurrence?

makeup_or_nah,1593161360,"I’m newly 24.  Family history of breast cancer in at least my maternal grandmother.  Family history of fibroadenomas &amp; uterine fibroids in my aunts on my dad’s side, leukemia in one of my cousins on my dad’s side, and Dad has myxoid liposarcoma which is a cancer of the fatty tissues in the body.  Found a lump in my left breast about a year ago but didn’t do anything about it at the time because we were between insurance and doctors at the time, and the last thing we needed during my dad’s third battle with cancer was news about me.  Finally got a doctor within the past few months and told her about the lump and was sent for ultrasound imaging due to the size.  BI-RADS score on my results was 3.  Tumor is 2.7 cm x 1.3cm x 2.4 cm.  There’s some vascularity according to the report but it mentions it’s not significant.  I know birads 3 means there’s a far better chance of it being benign than malignant, but given the prevalence of cancer on my dad’s side and my maternal grandmother having died of breast cancer, “probably benign” without any biopsy being done doesn’t exactly reassure me.  Had the ultrasound on the left breast two weeks ago and since then a rapidly growing mass that feels about the same as the other one, except a good deal flatter has popped up in my right breast.  Given that that one has developed so rapidly I’m even more spooked now, and determined to push for both to be biopsied and the second to be ultrasound imaged even though my doctor didn’t think it was necessary when I told her about the second lump.  The second lump is probably between dime and quarter sized.  I already have a follow up for the first lump’s tracking scheduled for December and my doc seems to be blowing off the idea of any imaging or tests for the second till then.  Should I be more insistent about getting biopsied so I know for sure what I’m dealing with?

As far as genetics goes outside of family history I’ve never had genetic screening done so I have no idea if I have any mutations that might put me at a higher risk of breast cancer.

The anxiety of not knowing for sure what’s going on is eating at me.  Even if this turns out not to be cancer, do you have any suggestions for how to cope with the waiting for answers?  How do you manage that kind of anxiety?"
themostacceptable,1593159438,"This is mostly me crying in a message, and a little bit the actual reason why I'm questioning it.

I'm 27 and was diagnosed last September with stage 2 triple positive DCIS that spread to an axillar lymph node. I finished chemo in January, had a lumpectomy in February, completed 6 weeks of radiation, and am continuing Herceptin and Perjeta through September. My oncologist briefly brought up tamoxifen during my big diagnosis and treatment plan discussion, but just handed me a paper and said we'd talk about it when I finish chemo...then when I finished chemo she said when I finish radiation...then just prescribed it without discussing it. At the post chemo appointment, she said that because I have been so responsive to treatment, it may be overkill. I tried to discuss it with her but because of 'rona I wasn't able to see her and the nurse intercepted the call as usual. I told the nurse that I felt overwhelmed by the idea of the drug and that I didn't want to take it because five years makes me feel like I will never be ""me"" again, that I don't want more of a daily reminder, what the oncologist said, and that the doctor had almost brought up the possibility that it could cause uterine cancer and if I were to get cancer again, I would rather deal with one I know. The nurse said ""themostacceptable, that's stupid"" (clearly very professional) and then told me the chances of uterine cancer (though she gave me the wrong statistics) and said it was ""stupid"" to risk my life because I don't want hot flashes (which i never mentioned being a reason). Oh, and she also told me it's going to be 10 years, not 5. Needless to say, I'm really hoping I never have to deal with her again.
Anyway, back to my point. Last week I saw the oncologist who asked how tamoxifen is going. I admitted I haven't started it yet. She told me because I'm so young with nothing in my genetic paneling, I have a high chance of recurrence and this is how to reduce that chance. ""Try it for a month and if you hate it, we'll discuss your options."" It came in the mail yesterday. I read the information packet unable to hold back tears. The clinical studies aspect makes to seem not worth it alone. 2000 with DCIS - 17/1000 for placebo had recurrence. 10/1000 for tamoxifen had recurrence. Also, it says in the packet there is no proven benefit for women under 35.

tvshowfinatic,1593136364,I had a biopsy done today. The area is bandaged up. Should I put gauze under the ice pack or put the ice pack straight on the bandage? They did say no to get the area wet. Sorry I’m a first timer.
therapych1ckens,1593127899,"Hello everyone, sorry to intrude here. I am a bit scared waiting for a biopsy procedure that won’t happen for another week. Long story short is I have to have 4 areas biopsied after having 3 sets of mammograms and a full breast ultrasound. Two areas of major concern were a spiculated mass near my armpit and an enlarged lymph node in my armpit. I was supposed to go out of town for two weeks starting Wednesday of next week. The doctor told me that if these images were his wife’s images, he would be cancelling the trip because we can’t wait to biopsy. Everything google tells me is scary. The urgency is scary :( I guess I’m reaching out to see if anyone else had a similar experience with the spiculated mass and enlarged lymph. Is there any chance it can’t be cancer at this point because I feel like more likely than not based on his descriptions, his urgency and stuff I’m reading on the net... it’s probably cancer?

Apologies for intruding into the community here. I’m a bit of a wreck waiting to be able to have biopsies done and I was curious about any experiences that may be similar to mine. My gyn ordered a left breast ultrasound and during the mammogram/ultrasound process, the doctor ordered the right side as well. Basically long story short of it is that I have 4 areas that have to be biopsied. 3 on the left, 1 on the right. One of the masses on the left is spiculated, and it’s located between my breast and armpit. Ultrasound of the left armpit also shows an enlarged lymph node. Everything I am reading looks horrifying. I guess at this point I’m wondering if anyone else has had similar ultra sound results, and is there a chance that it *couldnt* be cancer at this point :( I’m pretty scared. Thanks everyone &lt;3"

catteeth26,1593022332,"Hi all!

I (37F) finished my active treatment for Stage 1 hormone + BC last year and was prescribed Lupron monthly and Exemestane. The side effects have been very difficult: hot flashes, depression, v dryness, brain fog, joint pain, lack of libido. It had been somewhat manageable until about a couple month ago I developed severe joint pain in my fingers. 

It was unbearable so my doctor suggested taking a break from the Exemestane. Three weeks later and the pain has mostly subsided but now must decide whether to continue with the current regimen (and take intermittent breaks) or switch to Tamoxifen (would have to switch anti-depressants). 

Wondering if anyone has experience with the 2 treatments and advice. TY!"

It's now June of 2020 and the lump is still there - no better, no worse. I'm feeling fine and I wonder if this thing is a fibroadenoma or cyst or something (anything but the C word).

julesfoxx,1592872167,"Writing this to see if this has happened to anyone else, what to expect, success stories, reassurance...(especially success stories!)

In late May, my mid 50s mom was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. We were terrified and worried, but the first thing the oncologist said was ""Don't freak out!!! Your mom has a very common type of cancer and its VERY treatable! We think she will need a lumpectomy, radiation, and that's it! Do not worry its not aggressive!"" So this all started with stage 2 invasive lobular cancer. HER negative. Estrogen and progesterone positive. During biopsy, 1 lymph node tested positive but the rest and body/bone looks clear on scan. Negative bone scan. Entire body scan negative. (yay!) June 9, she had a lumpectomy, entire lymph node removal(they only found 8 and removed 8), and breast reduction. After her surgery, her oncologist and plastic surgeon said the surgery went far better than they expected. She even got her drains out 3 days early because she was healing so quickly!! We were ecstatic. The oncologist said chances are the lymph nodes would all test negative from what she saw...

The day after she had her drains removed, exactly a week after surgery, she got a call from her doctor. After testing the tissue and lymph nodes, every margin was clear except for the final margin they tested. Positive for cancer. And all 8 lymph node, every single one they took, came back positive for cancer. t's been now been upgraded to stage 3C, high risk. She goes back in July 9 (exactly a month from her initial surgery) to remove more tissue. Then in August, treating with 8 rounds of ACT chemo and then radiation and then 10 years of estrogen therapy.

So, obviously this has been a heartbreaking shock. My entire family is devastated. We had such happy high hopes and even joked around ""You are just getting a free breast lift!"" A complete shock to talk to the same oncologist who was so positive a happy and sure a few weeks ago, to her saying ""our whole team is completely in shock about your mom and sadly she is now considered high risk. Hopefully this will get it out of her.""

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I will take any advice at all. From the chemo (she is so sad to lose her hair so she is doing cold caps) to success stories of stage 3. Anything at all to help us sleep at night. I appreciate you all and this community. Thank you guys so much for listening!"

All in all I feel really lucky, it was discovered early and I tolerated treatment really well. But I've started experiencing some weird bone pain in my wrist and in my jaw (right below/behind my ear lobe). Both on the same side as the cancer. I keep telling myself this is not related to the cancer but then I keep slipping into thinking about it metastasizing. 

The likelihood this is cancer related is extremely low, right? Help convince me to stop worrying over the next couple weeks."

**Interesting Facts**

Did you know that about 10 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed around the world every year, and every year some 6 million people die of some form of cancer?

One interesting fact is that the United States has reportedly spent $4.8 to $5.2 billion per annul on cancer research and treatment development each year and growing!

To the women breast cancer is the most common cancer and sadly cancer is still the chief cause of death by disease in children between the ages of 3 and 14. Luckily there is research going on to find a cure for cancer and many treatments have been found out to have a good chance of curing cancer and living longer.

antriksh027,1592561286,"Hi guys,

My mother recently had her left breast removed. We are still doing the targeted chemo. But Soon after a month or two she developed a swelling on her left hand which doesn’t seem to go away and is just another INSULT to her body. On inquiring this we came to the knowledge that it might be due to some INFECTION and doctors are telling this might never go away. We regularly put magnesium sulaphate ointment on her hand two times a day and then wrap it up in a crepe bandage and she has an exercise regime like pressing a sponge ball and elevating her hand at most times. But all of this is to no avail the swelling seems to remain. 

So I just wanted to ask this community and those of you who have faced this. If you recovered from it how do go about it. What was the timeline it took for you to recover if it did coz I’m really concerned every morning she seems disappointed by looking at the state of her hand and it only breaks me apart, she has been such a strong lady and has brought three kids alone and it destroys me looking at her. Though she is taking it bravely but I know she is bothered that it might NEVER GO AWAY as the doctors have told.

I humbly request you guys to please ANSWER if you have personally gone through this or have seen anyone who has. Because I’m really bothered and in this country no doctor seems to have an answer."

I'm new to this forum but need some support. I just found out today that my mom's few rounds of taxol didn't work and that her tumors have been growing for the past 3-4 months. She has Triple Negative, Stage 4 Breast Cancer. I'm heartbroken as I quickly read up on the next treatment (eribulen), and it doesn't seem like it extends her life very much. She's in pain and has been adamantly trying to avoid neuropathy by wearing her ice packs during chemo, but apparently eribulen causes it as well. 

I just wish she could live so much longer. I want my baby to know her as he gets older. I can't help but to be overwhelmed with sadness right now. I had so much hope that taxol (chemo) was working. She said she might have even been able to feel it working and had a good feeling. I have modeled my life after her, she's my inspiration. I'm also heartbroken that I have to leave in a month for 5 months for mandatory job training. What can I do to get over my grief and help her to live her happiest life?

Puddycat007,1592436333,"First off, I am not asking for a diagnosis. Just need to rant about what's going on.

A couple weekends ago I found a lump in my breast. I figured it was nothing and would check again later. This past week I checked again and it was still there. Prior to finding this lump I started noticing changes in the shape of my boob/nipple. I've been brushing it off as a normal part of having big beautiful breast and getting older. Rationally I know the body changes over time but once I found this lump that isn't going away, I did my research and realized I have multiple symptoms of breast cancer. First off, my areola grew into an odd shape a few years back. I've always been intrigued by it but as you will soon read, have never been able to get it checked out. More recently, I've noticed the skin where my areola used to end is being pulled inside my breast. It is very subtle, so again didn't think much about it. This space where my extra areola is sometimes feels as if sandpaper is being rubbed back and forth over it. Also, I occasionally experience, what I describe as, a hollow needle wrapped in sandpaper stabbing through my breast into my chest in the area I found the lump. The lump itself is not painful. I am not sure, but the boob that is experiencing all this might be growing as well. Can't say for certain, but I do have to adjust it away from my arm for comfort these days which is new. Lastly, I was told every female on my dad's side has had breast cancer. 

I have an appointment with Planned Parenthood to get checked out but it's not till next Friday (They were closed this week, ugh). I found a program in my state that would qualify me for free testing and treatment if needed. I was really really hoping I could sign up for that program and start the testing process this Friday instead of going through PP (which I would have to pay for). I don't have health insurance. I make less than 30k/year and cannot afford to pay full price for health insurance, which is around 500 or more a month. I have tried to sign up for health insurance with tax credits (bringing my premium down to around 150/month which I could manage) but because my mom signed me up for medicare when I was in her care, I do not qualify for tax credits. I only have medicare part A (hospital only) thus cannot use it for this or any other checkup stuff. I have been battling the health insurance market place and medicare for 2 years now trying to get all of that figured out so I can have affordable health care (I am 28, so even though I have medicare part A I do not qualify for Medicare part B). But, unfuckinfortunately for me, nobody i've spoken or met with knows how to help me get rid of the medicare part A so I can pay for health insurance that I can actually use. I am really really upset about all this because I know I would have had a physical and talked to a doctor sometime in the last couple years about whats going on with me if I had the opportunity. Additionally, the wellness program I mentioned earlier is no longer running due to COVID19. I spent an hour trying to reach someone there today until I finally chose a different extension and was told it's not running. I was directed to a low cost clinic. The lady I got ahold of this time was very nice and listened to me crying while I explained everything. She told me she would try and find me an opening at all their locations. After a few minutes on hold she came back and told me nothing was available and all she could do was send my info to one of the clinics and they would call me in 3-4 weeks to schedule a new patient appointment. I WAS DEVASTATED. I am so angry that all of this is going on. I hate the American health care system. It really leaves the unwealthy out to die doesn't it.

I am really scared about the possibility of having breast cancer. I've already had a really pretty shitty life (foster care, mentally ill/ addicted parents, escaping child prostitution and being diagnosed with PTSD at 16) and after working on myself for the past 10+ years was just getting to a comfortable place of peace and prosperity.

Thank you for reading if you did. I am a nanny so I can't talk to anyone I work with about what's going on and don't have much support other than my partner and a friend or two that live in a different state."

TheLameLesbian,1592356984,"Hi everyone, It feels like the last month has been one awful waiting game. It feels like everytime I get more imaging or tests, something else needs to be tested after. Its been a month of “we need more”, and I am exhausted. I had a biopsy Thursday and today got the call that there are “atypical cells that they don’t want to over diagnose yet and need to do more lab tests on the cells”. I am frustrated, i have had 2 ultrasounds, a mri, a mammogram and mammogram biopsy. I think I am most upset at my doctor for just tip toeing around the diagnosis. The NP and radiologist both told me the strong suspicion was “stage 0 or 1”. The doctor keeps telling me its no big deal and she isn’t worried about it because Im 22. 
I am going in tomorrow because she wants to schedule a lumpectomy (because either way I need a lumpectomy) but this seems stupid without having the formal diagnosis. If I have DCIS shouldn’t I talk about my options, what if I want genetic testing done to know whether I have a gene mutation? I don’t want to go through this again. If my probability of having breast cancer again is high, I rather have a double mastectomy and move on with my life. I feel like my doctor is being very pushy and I want the full picture before I schedule a lumpectomy. Does anyone have any advice or guidance on all of this? I honestly feel blind and don’t know how to properly approach this with my doctor. Thanks in advance :)"

I have felt a small lump in my left breast for some time now, so today I got it checked out. The doctor could not feel the lump at all, and explained to me that what I was feeling was probably my ribs (?) The doctor then ordered me to get a sonogram, and nothing showed as well. 

Although the doctor and sonogram informed my there is nothing to worry about, I still feel uneasy because I still feel that small lump &amp; is unsure why it present. Is it actually by rib? Why can I feel it but the doctor could not identify it?

I would appreciate it if anyone could clarify this for me/ or if anyone have similar experience? I just want peace of mind.

JeanneMPod,1592293717,"Right now I still have tissue expanders (all filled), should be getting on the reconstruction train later this summer. (If covid spikes doesn't make another delay that is.) 

I have an assortment of new bras, mostly pretty soft and seamless. Still, when I'm behind on laundry, I might not have my preferred ones to sleep in, another level of soft. Now I'm modest-medium-small-ish at the moment with the tissue expanders. Sometimes my old incision areas get a little touchy when I wear my normal day bras to bed, and my favorites need a wash. I've found if I take a seamless tank top (or cut it so it's mostly seamless, especially in the armpit area) , cut and tie the straps so they sit up a little more, and either cut and tie a knot in the front, or just pull the bottom up and over the neck and then tie it off (sometimes with a hair tie), it give a little support without anything irritating any skin or feeling constantly daytime-level ""bound"". (Many of you probably miss that ""take off the bra moment at the end of the day if you're going through something similar. )Now I had a doctor who wanted me to have less binding/constriction in the beginning, then a bit more as I healed. I think this is in the range of acceptable for sleep. 

Also- I'm a side sleeper. I finally got the ok to go back to my favorite position, but I still need something between the tissue expanders when I'm in that position With both the soft bras and my dyi sleep tank-bras, I usually take a soft piece of material-another tank or soft nightie type thing, and -tuck that between my cups. Gives a feeling of soft middle shelf that keeps the expanders from a folding like sensation.

If you're big breasted and planning for something similar for your reconstruction, you should probably ignore this, as more specific proper bras for the job are needed around the clock most likely."

I realize it’s very rare for someone my age to have breast cancer, but the lump itself I think may have gotten bigger. There are two of them and they’re smooth like two round balls. One of them feels quite big.

They look almost like bruises, but are painless and haven’t changed at all. I started running a low grade fever around the same time that the purple spots appeared. I was tested for COVID-19 (negative) and still had the fever despite a course of antibiotics. No other signs of illness or infection ever appeared. When I had the mammogram, they also took additional images and then did an ultrasound. The radiologist came in at that point, and did the ultrasound a second time. She then told me I had a cluster of suspicious microcalcifcations, and that they recommend a biopsy ASAP. She said it likely could be benign, but then started throwing around terms of DCIS and early signs, which threw me off a bit on how to feel. They then had me meet with a patient navigator who explained the biopsy and set up appointments for me with the surgeon and also for the actual biopsy. Needless to say I’m pretty nervous about the whole scenario. I get the biopsy on Thursday, and time feels like it’s moving so excruciatingly slowly. I’m only 36, but my mother was diagnosed with DCIS for the first time at age 48.

Defiant_Scale,1592264431,"Apologies- as this may go off into a incoherent diatribe. 

My wife early 40's, was diagnosed Stage 3 TNBC back in October.  Since then she completed Chemo therapy (16 weeks I believe) with Taxol first and then AC.

Pathology came back clear- PCR is what they told us which we are grateful for.  Now recovering from Double Mastectomy w/reconstruction.

They are planning on possibly doing radiation but are consulting with other doctors first.  My wife is inclined to proceed, even after the regimen was discussed, possible side affects etc.

This Radiology Phone appt.(Covid) was an hour long and apparently was more in depth in going over her original scans, the amount of spread, aggressiveness and also the doctor telling her she will die if there's a recurrence- something even the oncologist never talked about- that what if. 

When she talked About her appointment with me she explained how frank this Doctor was but said he was very thorough.

 We are back at square one in terms of all the emotions, what if's, fears, how to explain to our girls- it's all just come flooding back.  All of the encouragement and ""positive thinking"" we've been doing seems to have been washed away, and we've been grounded again.

When we began this process we literally took it ""one day at a time"" and cried through appointments with no physical change in mass size etc.  With every little victory I always thought ok, making progress and if this doesn't work for a PCR, we still have the Mastectomy in our pocket, and if that doesn't work, we still have radiation up our sleeve.

Now however, we've reached nearly the end of treatment with a decision largely on my wife on whether to proceed with radiation.

I am now terrified, we've used up all resources possible once radiation is done and I feel she's then free to ""float and Bob in the ocean""- with zero tricks left up our sleeves.

It's just a wired feeling- the unknown, being robbed of piece of mind."

Does MD Anderson (MDA) accept out-of-state patient appointment during COVID?

We are in California, tried to make an appointment but their answer is they don't accept out-of-state patient now. And without in person appointment, they won't provide any treatment plan consulting either. So this is like we reached an impasse.

A close friend of mine in her early 30s was recently diagnosed IV breast cancer. Cancer has spread to her liver which makes her liver too weak to take any further chemotherapy. We are in San Diego California. Her oncologist now can only gives hormones to promote her liver functionality and is trying to have her liver recover to the level that can take chemo again. But this may take time and no one is sure about if this will work. (now no signs of working)

She later visited a MD Anderson branch in La Jolla, San Diego. But there is only one oncologist there. The local MDA doctor seconded the first doctor's treatment plan and has nothing else to add.

We are thinking does she need to visit Houston MDA to get some alternative or better treatment plan? like some novel treatments such as CAR-T. But apparently Houston MDA refused us as we are in California. They mentioned they don't accept out of state patient anymore. and we can just visit local California MDA branch (which is a small clinic) instead of visiting Texas main campus. But there is only one young oncologist in San Diego MDA branch.

Or is it possible to ask the local MDA oncologist to start a remote diagnosis or discussion meeting of any novel /alternative treatment plan with experts in MDA's main campus in Houston? So far the local MDA oncologist didn't propose anything like this.

She is so young in her early 30s and we don't want to give up. Any suggests are very much appreciated!"
codecowboy,1592236615,"My wife had a oncology appointment last Thursday on the 11th.  We both had a feeling of dread going into this appointment.  Over the last few months her recovery time from the chemo has been getting worse and worse.  This last treatment she never truly recovered from.  There was not a single day we would call a ""good"" day even by our lowered standards over the past 4 weeks.  Further more she had been experiencing more pain in her back and a tightness in her abdomen. So we went in to this appointment with the anticipation that her cancer was growing again and that she was also getting toxic from nine months of continuous chemo.

&amp;#x200B;

We waited in the room for 45 minutes as the doctor was running behind.  When he walked into the room you knew immediately he did not have good news for us by his demeanor.  He was kind as always, but had to be direct concerning the scans.   The cancer in her spine is growing and has spread.  The cancer in her liver grew with numerous new tumors that were all almost 0.8cm in size.  The worst part was that her bilirubin count, which had always been stable, doubled in between her last two bloodwork samples.  This concerned him the most.  We were not four minutes into the meeting when he looked at her and said, ""Unfortunately I think we are at the point I have to ask you if your affairs are in order.""  Needless to say it was a gut punch for both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically she is a time bomb right now.  Her liver is starting to fail.  The tumors could grow and block the ducts or the tumors could just grow and cause the liver to stop functioning.  The increased bilirubin counts indicates that is starting to happen.  We go back in two weeks for more bloodwork and to visit the oncologist.  The oncologist said that if those numbers continue to rise dramatically we will likely have to make some hard choices at that visit.  

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly the choices are not that hard.  There is another chemo we can try, but if it's going to only buy her time where she's miserable and unable to function she is not interested in that.  She is not strong enough for chemo now.  So we are taking two more weeks off of chemotherapy and will decide if we are permanently discontinuing at the next meeting.  

&amp;#x200B;

Cancer just sucks.   We knew this was coming.  But knowing does nothing to lessen the emotional impact of knowing that the time is here."

I’ve had a nipple sacrificing, skin sparing mastectomy and do not need radiotherapy. 

My oncologist has stated that chemotherapy will give an additional 4% assurance and the decision is mine to make. My main treatment will be tamoxifen which will provide the majority of the benefits.

I know the side effects of the chemo, but not first hand. I’ve also read that the chemo can result in cardiac issues (the figures given to me were 4% risk). 

I feel like doing the chemo would be trading a risk of cancer recurrence for a risk of cardiac issues, along with the myriad of other side effects.

foryourbreast,1592163770,"A new study has shown that squeezing the breast can help prevent the growth of malignant breast cells, which leads to cancer.

Laboratory experiments have shown that physical pressure on these cells led to their return to normal growth.

According to scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, USA, the results of the study may lead to new types of treatment.

""For many centuries, people have known that physical pressure affects our body,"" explained study author Gautam Venugopalan. ""When we lift weights, our muscles increase in size. The force of gravity is necessary to maintain strong bones. Now we have shown that physical strength plays a role in the growth of cancer cells or its prevention.""

During the study, malignant breast epithelial cells were grown inside a gel inserted into flexible silicone cavities. During the first stage of cell growth, scientists applied compression, which effectively crushed the cells.

Subsequently, the cells began to grow normally and more organized. Cells that were not compressed continued to grow uncontrollably, leading to cancer.

mommymeansit,1591925748,"I am in treatment for high grade ductal carcinoma, er/pr +, her2-; I had 2 lumpectomies and ducts (clear) in late January and then radiation. I’ve just started hormone therapy. 

The tumor was on the right outside of breast. Since surgery, I’ve had dimpling on the inside of my right breast. My radiology oncologist said this was normal after surgery. I’m a bit concerned that it’s lasted this long, though, given that the orange peel look is a symptom of metastatic cancer. 

Has anyone else had this?"
snowcone227,1591919234,"We think it’s good since it can see tumors in dense breasts but I am hearing so many horror stories on here that they didn’t catch it and it was only a biopsy that told them it was cancer. Imagine other women thinking they are safe and years later their cancer advances and kills them! Stop using ultrasounds and MRI’s!!!!! They are not reliable!!!! Take a biopsy for any suspicious lump you feel!!!!!

Let me clarify!!!!! Yes take a ultrasound but don’t just be satisfied once they said it’s nothing. Get biopsy anyways cause of many false negatives"
Snoo86479,1591914701,"Hello I am 23
So for almost 3-4 years ago I have disovered a hard bigl ump right behind my nipples on my left boob.  And also it is only on my left breast and my left breast is larger compared to the right breast. 
And since a year, I get weird on and off pain in my shoulder, back, hand and on my breast itself (left side). When I lie down it gets better but it is on &amp; off everyday.
I am too scared to go for a checkeup. I have been stalling it for years and I have no courage to go because I feel it is Breast cancer. &amp; also I am praying it is fibrocystic breast since they have kinda same symptoms too.
Please anyone experienced this let me know. Please.
I am freaking out so bad."

bigd_partyzone,1591825102,"Hey, everyone. I’m hoping for some help. 

My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer on 5/14. She just began chemo (AC at the moment) and is having a difficult time finding things that she can eat. She has never been a “good” eater and I’m concerned that her body won’t have the fuel it needs to heal if she is only eating eggs, toast, and crackers. I’m frustrated that the help that myself and others try to provide isn’t working...and I’m frustrated with myself for being frustrated and making this about me and a bruised ego. 


Someone brought her a “cooking with cancer” cookbook and it really upset her. I told her that I didn’t understand why - which I should not have done - and that upset her more. She can’t eat the meals from Freshly that her coworkers arranged for her. Someone bought her a Nutri Bullet and when I sent her recipes, most had spinach or kale in them which made her feel like I’m pushing vegetables on her. I’m trying to help and be as empathetic as I can as she goes through this horribly scary and unfamiliar thing. I need some help.

imacatsrsly,1591796911,"Hey everyone. I posted a while ago about surgery coming up. I'm having difficulty deciding what to do. My surgical oncologist and plastic surgeon are both pushing for me to only have one breast done.

Here's the scoop... No genetic high risk. Stage 3 IDC on right side with one lymph node involved. Because of the multiple spread out lesions I will need to have a skin sparing mastectomy on the right side (will lose my nipple) with reconstruction. Nothing NEEDS to be done with the left side medically.

I am very concerned with symmetry of my breasts and am leaning towards having both done. Also I am afraid I will worry about developing cancer in the other breast, even though doctors have assured me that I'm not ""at an increased risk"" for that.

The plastic surgeon also said that they could do a small implant on the good side down the road but it wouldn't be a complete match and having an implant makes it harder to screen for cancer via mammogram. Soooo why not just get it all removed then?

Just fyi I don't care about losing the sensation of the nipple or breast. I know a lot of women experience some sexual dysfunction with that but it's something I have never cared about and will not miss. I'm more concerned with the appearance and symmetry of my breasts.

As I said I'm leaving towards just having a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction but I can't help but feel like I'm dumb for doing so.



So I'm looking to you for advice. Has anyone just opted to have both done and are happy with it? Has anyone only had one done and were happy with it? Has anyone regretted having both or one done?

I need to decide by the end of this week 😔"

mayonnaisemonarchy,1591760677,"Got my genetic results today and found out that I have the ATM mutation which is why I have cancer at 29. Yay.

Anyone else have this mutation? I don't have any others. I just had a lumpectomy two weeks ago and am wondering if I'll need a prophylactic DMX now. I'm headed into my oncologist's on Friday to talk with the genetic counselor and then I meet with my oncologist to discuss treatment on June 22. Why does time slow down so much when you're battling a disease? Blurgh."
WeightliftingTA,1591760256,"I am gutted. My (42m) wife (42f) found a painful lump about a month ago that the doctor palpated and thought it was nothing to worry about. We followed up today with a mammogram which showed enough that they did a biopsy on the spot. Lymph nodes looked fine on scan but also biopsied.

General doctor thinks it is likely cancer, but I am not super confident in her assessment. Friend who is oncologist says he felt because if her age, and that it hurt, it was more likely to be a hormonal thing. Neither have seen the reports yet, but general spoke to the radiologist.

I am in shock. Gutted. Disoriented.

We have to sit around and wait until biopsy comes back in 4 days. My mother died of cancer, my wife already survived thyroid cancer once. 

I have no idea where to begin."
LeSkinnyPeen,1591735171,"Hi everybody, I came to this subreddit because my mother (42 F) has a very painful lump on her upper breast. She went to the doctor and got an ultrasound, and they just called her back saying that they didn’t see anything and would like to do further testing (a mammogram I believe.) 

If they didn’t see anything on the ultrasound does that rule out breast cancer? I understand it rules out a cyst, her doctor said that fluid shows up really well on an ultrasound.

I guess what I’m asking is, should I be worried that they ordered further testing? We have a family history of breast cancer."
Yellow-squirrels,1591710670,"I've just had this news today and I'm devastated.

I'm sorry that I don't have all the technical details. I was really young the first time she was diagnosed but I'll try and give as much info as possible.

My mum was first diagnosed in her early thirties. It was understandably a huge shock. It was serious, but not terminal, but there was no guarantee she would survive. I would guess on that basis it was stage 3? It was hormone receptive.

She had a mascectomy on the affected breast, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. She was very very ill but she survived.

Around 5-6 years later it came back in her other breast. It was early stages and she had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. Hormone receptive again. 

Now, 10 years after that, it is back again in the same breast. Again it is early stages and my mum is being very calm about it. We don't know at this stage whether it is hormonal but my mum suspects not as she has been through the menopause. 

I just feel devastated. I'm a worrier by nature and feel like given the span this thing has been attacking her it is just never going to let up, is it? I just feel like one way or another this awful disease is determined to take her and I'm just so, so upset.

We have had the genetic testing and apparently it is not genetic so I'm not sure if that makes it even stranger that it keeps returning.

I know some people on this thread will have it so much worse and I'm sorry. My SIL (who is 29) has stage 4 breast cancer so I know it can be so much worse, but this is just raw today and I'm struggling to cope.

I don't want to worry forever that this awful disease is going to come back and eventually win, but I feel like it is just inevitable. Does anyone have any stories where this *doesn't* happen?

For reference my mum is 49, she will be 50 in August.

Thanks and sending love to everyone in this community"

erinyslyric,1591612108,"I first wanted to thank everyone who commented on my last post. You were all so kind and supportive, and helped me put things in a better perspective. I'm still struggling with everything, but I'm handling it better than I was.

Now, for an update. It's been 3 weeks since mum's radiation treatment, and she's still going strong so far. Been completely weaned off the steroids as well. So far so good. She's still unsteady, and is having trouble with her fine motor skills. She needs to really concentrate for her hands to work properly, but she's coping.

The doctor has said when she does backslide, it'll be quick, same as before, so, with any ""luck"" at all, she won't be in that state for long before she goes. Sounds weird saying (typing?) it out loud, but that really is the best case scenario now. Everything has been planned for ""after"", so that's something less to worry about.

A lot of family are visiting, on and off, for a day or two. All my mum's family live near the border, or in Wales or England, so it's hard for them to get here. My sister and niece visited, and my favourite aunt, so that's good. I got slightly irked by the couple of family members that have said they'll pray for her. They know her well enough that it means nothing to her. Or they should.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for faith if you have it, and I know that it's how they cope. But it doesn't help us, because we don't have that faith. And it's my parents that need the most help right now. One of them is visiting tomorrow, and I can't go see them, because I wouldn't be able to hold my tongue if they said it again.

I'm painfully aware of the limited time she has left, and the fact that it could literally happen any time. I can't visit as often as I would like, and this has just increased the amount of time before I can visit again. I'm so scared that I won't get the chance, and today, I finally broke. Not very much, but the walls are coming down. I guess I'm still fighting to keep them up, because I think if they come down completely, I'll cease to function.

I'm sorry, this turned into me just spewing everything out in one big...thing. I'm just lost, I guess, and still trying to keep myself together. Thanks for reading my nonsense, again. Keep on keeping on, and stay strong. Insert common platitude here.

Love to you all."

I got the ultrasound done and nothing was found because the lump is deep and my breast tissue is “very dense”. I got an MRI done Friday and am getting the results Tuesday. I have been in so much pain today to the point of nausea. Does anyone have any recommendations? I tried tylenol and advil but  they don’t last long and it is obviously making my nausea worse. Thanks so much and I hope you all are well"
MidnightStarChaser,1591575665,"I found the lump by chance and when I went to the OB she said it was moveable and soft and although it was likely a fibroadenoma, she wanted an ultrasound to be sure. I held off on the ultrasound for a few weeks because the idea scared me. Ultrasound was mid-March and from there the radiologist said it looked concerning and needed a biopsy. I was told not to call and the hospital would call me. The state shut down due to COVID 2 days later. The place my insurance requires me to go said my biopsy was considered “nonessential” and referred me out. My insurance said it would be super expensive to go there, so I waited. And waited. Mid May they still weren’t doing biopsies and I lost my shit and made the appointment for the more expensive place. 

They called and told me it’s invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3. Tumor markers came back a few days later as triple negative with a proliferation rate of 60%. Everything escalated so quickly from there. Mammogram, bilateral ultrasound, and MRI followed by an MRI guided biopsy tomorrow for the masses found only by said MRI in my other breast. I’ve met with a breast surgeon, genetic counselor (because no one in my family has breast cancer), and an oncologist. Oncologist said it’s stage 2, so at least there’s that? Chemo starts on the 16th, port placement the day before (anyone know if the closeness of the date of the port being placed and chemo starting is going to make the first infusion extra terrible?). 20 weeks of chemo total (12 weekly of taxol and carboplatin then 8 weeks of biweekly adriamycin and cytoxan), then 4 weeks to recover, then surgery and 4 more weeks to recover from the mastectomy. I will likely need radiation after.

I’m a nurse in a large hospital and because of the COVID pandemic, my oncologist strongly advised that I stop working once chemo starts (she basically said “I won’t tell you not to work if you insist, but I’ll write whatever letters/notes are necessary to ensure you don’t work”). I’m supposed to stop working until after the surgery recovery. I applied for short term disability through work, but they won’t process it until I officially stop working (which is soon), and there’s always the chance they’ll deny it. If the claim is denied I will for sure have to go back to work - otherwise I’ll be without insurance. The unknown disability status and work status is making me feel super anxious. I know they’re laying off nurses who can’t float to COVID units, so I’m partially afraid they’ll just deny the claim and then lay me off (I realize this is probably illegal, but I’m just so anxious and my brain is a mess). People keep telling me to take it one day at a time and I’m just not good at that...I’m a planner. I suppose I’ll have to learn to deal with the unknown.

I feel so overwhelmed. I’m very independent and I don’t know how to not work and ask others for help. The triple negative diagnosis overwhelms me (triple negative sounded so good until they explained it to me…). I don’t know anything about chemo and didn’t realize my treatment schedule is aggressive until I started reading the massive book the office gave me (although it seems fairly standard for a triple negative breast cancer diagnosis). I’m mad I waited a few weeks to get the ultrasound (although I’m trying not to focus on that). I’m mad a biopsy was deemed “nonessential.” 

I’ve also realized the idea of losing my hair scares me more than losing my boobs, which feels incredibly conceited and shallow. I’m slowly processing the rest of all this shit, but I’m struggling the most with the hair loss. The oncology office talked with me about cold capping, but I’m concerned that it’ll just be too much with how aggressive my treatment plan is. I already run pretty cold normally and have poor extremity circulation, plus the nurses will be icing my hands and feet during the taxol portion. Adding head ice sounds like a lot of fucking ice, and doing it for 16 rounds total and every week for 12 weeks sounds like hell. I can’t really find much info about women who have TNBC trying cold capping. Does anyone have any experience with cold capping that they’d be willing to share? I’ve heard it feels like a brain freeze or migraine for the entire icing period.

Thanks for listening to my rant."

foryourbreast,1591543051,"Such statistics are found by doctors-mammologists, to whom patients with artificial Breasts come for an appointment. 
The reason for deletion is different for everyone, and among the most common are:

- replacement of implants every 5-7 years. Very often plastic surgeons are silent about the fact that after a while the skin on the chest will stretch and the ""perfect"" shape will creep down.

- unnatural breast shape and sensation. Implants can not even be installed in theory so that the breast looks natural. And this chest feels like a ball of water.

- problems with a sexual partner. The breast is a zone of trust in a woman, left to us from motherhood. The sexual partner subconsciously accumulates a negative attitude to artificiality and over time such couples break up.

- scars, scarring, anesthesia, complications. After surgery, there are always scars under the breast, around the nipple or under the armpit. And the operation itself is performed under General anesthesia, which can have a bad effect on the nervous system and the work of the excretory organs.

Based on all this, doctors-mammologists dissuade patients who have decided on breast augmentation from surgery, if this procedure is exclusively plastic in nature.
But the situation when a woman tries to restore her breast after breast removal or for medical reasons looks very different."

The guidelines for detecting breast cancer are improved and safer than ever before with the techniques of mammography and the low-dose X-ray equipment now being used, certainly safer than in the 1990s according to most experts. 

The trends and new techniques revealed in this discussion will be of interest to women of all ages as questions are answered concerning mammograms, needle aspiration, and the need for watchful monitoring to avoid needless tragedies.

**Q. How many different types of breast cancer are there?** 

A. There are several different types according to what we call histology that's what we see under the microscope. There are perhaps two or three major types, and there are several minor, less frequent types. But there's one type that is most common. It's called duct cell carcinoma. 

**Q. Is this the type that most women are warned about?** 

A. That's the type that most women run into if they are unfortunate enough to have breast cancer. 

**Q. Can this type be detected at an early stage?** 

A. The greatest advance in detecting [breast cancer](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=breast+cancer) at an early stage is through the use of mammography. As a matter of fact, it's unfortunate that the concern about radiogenic effects of mammography is keeping many women away from having mammography. If a radiologist can pick up a cancer on the X ray of a breast, at a time when I can't feel it or see it, this is an immense advantage. 

**Q. What is the prevalent age group for getting cancer?** 

A. The prevalence increases with age. At age 15, it's practically zero. In the twenties, one begins to see a few patients with breast cancer, but most of the time it's women 30 and over. At age 45, it becomes much more prevalent. 

***Breast Self Examination***

![video](ctiyal7zbh351)

**Q. Do environmental, stress, and nutritional factors in the United States enter into some of the causes of cancer?** 

A. There is a great deal of epidemiological research going on in this area. It is well known, for example, that breast cancer in Japanese women living in Japan is remarkably lower than the incidence in the United States, England, France, and other countries. It also appears that when Japanese women move to Hawaii and live there, and then when they come to the mainland United States and live here for a while, the incidence begins to approach that which occurs here. There have been a number of theories about this disparity, one of them suggesting nutrition, but we really don't know the answers to that yet. 

**Q. What are the best preventive measures against breast cancer?** 

A. I can't really say I know of any sure way to prevent breast cancer. Currently, there is a great deal of interest in the possibility that a low fat diet may be helpful, and there is research directed toward determining whether such a diet could lower the incidence of breast cancer or reduce the recurrence rate in women who have had a [mastectomy](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/what-is-difference-between-lumpectomy-and-segmental-mastectomy.html). [Dr. Michael Smith](https://www.blogger.com/profile/15471498159573739722) has reported a statistical study suggesting that women who have had a full term pregnancy early in life (age 21 or less) have a lower incidence of breast cancer. I do not have information any later than that. 

**Q. What is the general age range of women who come to you for mammography?** 

A. We see very young women who come in for [mammography](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=mammography), but we don't perform mammograms on them unless we feel there is a real reason for it. That would usually be a lump, and even then those lumps are usually benign. We do a limited study on them. Usually, it is just the one breast for women under 30. If they are over 30, we use some judgment. If there is nothing that is worrisome, we do an oblique lateral of each breast for comparison. We begin doing mammography on women as a screening or routine between the ages of 35 and 45. A. It's important to differentiate between what we call screening and routine. By screening, we're talking about doing mammography or any kind of examination in women who are asymptomatic. In other words, a woman comes in every year having no problems at all and has a mammogram. On the other hand, if a woman has a lump in the breast, that's diagnostic. In that case, we're trying to find out what that specific lump means and what it is. And that is only with one exposure. Obviously, we don't really get concerned about that one exposure when it may mean the difference between life and death for a patient. On the other hand, if you are going to X ray a woman every year who is age 15 and has a life expectancy of well into the seventies and now possibly into the eighties, she would have a lot of radiation exposure over a period of years. So we differentiate in screening, and that is why Dr. Snyder talks about routine when there is a lump and screening as a matter of a later age.

![video](o8d1j1b4ch351)

**Q. Are there more advances today in detecting early stages of breast cancer?** 

A. Infinitely. As of about 15 years ago, the only way we generally detected breast cancer was when the woman felt the lumps or if she happened to see a [doctor](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/04/how-do-doctors-detect-breast-cancer.html) who felt the lumps. Now we can detect breast cancer by mammography, and it is within the last 10 to 15 years that the mammogram has become so advanced in this country. We are able to detect cancer before it can be seen or felt. The way we find it is by the mammogram, and the way we can prove it is a cancer is by removing the area and looking at it under the microscope. This requires a special technique. 

**Q. Mammography has had a bad reputation, it seems, because some doctors are divided on its safety. What should women understand about this?** 

A. [Mammography](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/how-much-does-breast-reconstruction-cost-after-mastectomy.html) that we performed in the 1990s was really a high exposure and, by present standards, very poor quality. You can talk about mammography, but I'm more interested in good quality mammography of low dose. Techniques have improved. We use special equipment, special film, and reduced doses. We are getting a fraction of a rad exposure now. In fact, with our improved techniques, the average exposure is less than a tenth of a rad absorbed dose per breast for two exposures. And that is very low. The radiation dosage to the midbreast of two rads calculated to be the amount given by mammography in the 1990s and considered high enough to place the breast at risk was based on the high doses actually received by some women with a higher than expected risk of breast cancer. Some had been exposed to the atomic bomb, some to repeated fluoroscopy, and others to radiation treatment. When you talk about the dangers of mammography, you are speaking about an absorbed dose. If a breast receives two rads, and that was based on very high doses from other types of examinations, we are now talking about a twentieth to a thirtieth of the two rad dose that theoretically might be dangerous. We are using a much better technique so that it is much easier for us to make a diagnosis with very little radiation. 

![img](9aaxulo5dh351 ""Breast Biopsy"")

**Q. There is concern about the age at which mammography is done, and there is a great deal of concern that women under 35 would be harmed by accumulated radiation. Are these valid fears?** 

A. The basis for being afraid of radiation was the exposures that young women got from repeated tests for tuberculosis and mastitis, usually women in their teens and twenties and women under 30. We feel that the young breast is more susceptible to radiation, so we're looking at the dividing line of 35 because that is almost past the childbearing age and is also when the breast cancer incidence begins to increase. 

**Q. What actually takes place during a mammography?** 

A. Usually there are two exposures of the breast, and the technique we employ uses a compression of the breast which causes some women to feel very uncomfortable. But when you think about the fact that radiation exposure is reduced so much by this technique and the quality of the [X ray](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=X+ray) is so much improved, the discomfort is a minor inconvenience. The whole test takes only about five to ten minutes. 

***Breast Reconstruction Surgery***

![video](9z1nfcu8ch351)

**Q. How often is the test required to be taken?** 

A. At Sloan Kettering, some women get it once a year because of their family history or because they've had a mastectomy in the past. Some women come in once every two years. The woman who has had previous breast cancer has greatest risk for the other breast. Therefore, that woman should have a mammogram at least once a year. In general, doctors recommend once a year, some twice a year in addition to periodic clinical examination by a physician. The other people who are at highest risk are those who have a strong family history of breast cancer. These are at higher risk than the average woman. 

**Q. Is mammography the best way to date to detect those cells you can't see and can't feel?** 

A. Unquestionably. 

**Q. Ultrasound is reported to be a little safer but more expensive as a means of detection. Is this a good alternative?** 

A. While there has been great hope for ultrasound as a screening modality for the detection of breast cancer, it has still not replaced mammography. The microcalcifications found on mammography, which appear to represent the earliest manifestations of [breast cancer](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/what-is-adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-breast-cancer.html) (at a stage when it is not palpable by the clinician), are not detectable by ultrasound. This is a serious deficiency as compared to mammography. Ultrasound does help to determine whether a lump is solid or cystic. However, the surgeon may determine this readily by attempting aspiration. If he or she obtains fluid, the lesion is obviously cystic in most cases. 

**Q. How large are the lumps that are detected?** 

A. Lumps that can be detected by mammography are from an eighth to a quarter inch in diameter and maybe slightly less in size, but it's not until half to one inch in diameter that a lump can be detected by physical examination. This could take as many as ten years after it had been detected by mammography. 

**Q. Doctors at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach tested 76 women with X ray, mammography, and ultrasound according to a press report a couple of years ago. Each method diagnosed nine of the ten cases of cancer. The new method used by the doctors requires the patient to be prone on a special bed with an opening through which the breasts are immersed in a pool of water warmed to body temperature. For 15 minutes, underwater imaging devices focus on the breast, taking a large series of pictures which reveal the breasts' internal anatomy in extraordinary detail. The doctors went on to report that not only can the method detect growth, at least as well as X ray, but that it can also identify and locate cysts in women with dense breast tissue, something X rays can't do very well. Is this new research a hopeful procedure for the future?** 

A. [Ultrasound](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/what-an-ultrasound-can-detect-can-you-see-cancer-in-the-abdomen-with-ultrasound.html) has a great future, I'm sure. The reason that mammography is not 100 percent effective is because breasts are so different. Some breasts are very glandular and dense, and mammography cannot identify localized masses unless there is something like calcification or a very dense mass. So that's where ultrasound is helpful in going through a dense breast and picking out solid and dense masses. The type of ultrasound used in the Florida trial is a small series, and it is time consuming, expensive, and experimental. Mammograms can be done in all of five to ten minutes, as I mentioned. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Speaking of time saving methods, there is a sort of supermarket detection center idea being formed. What are these centers doing?** 

A. You are referring to what are being called one stop breast care centers. These centers, which are opening up across the country, are set up to conduct thorough testing and give women quick results. 

**Q. I read that these centers will have the most up to date diagnostic equipment, including such things as thermography, diaphonography, ultrasound, ductogram equipment, and, of course, mammography machines. What are all of these machines capable of doing?** 

A. Thermography equipment measures heat emissions from the breast and can identify tissue differences through varying heat conduction in [malignant tumors](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/what-does-malignant-cancer-mean-is-malignant-tumor-dangerous.html). Diaphonography reads light absorption patterns in the [breast](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/04/what-is-initial-symptoms-of-breast-cancer.html). Normal tissue does not absorb as much light as cancerous tissue. With ductogram equipment, a thin needle is inserted into the breast duct of a woman with abnormal breast discharges. A dye is injected, which will reveal benign duct tumors through color photography. We have discussed [ultrasound and mammograms](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/).

**Q. My wife had a spot on the upper right part of her lung and was taken to the hospital and given several X rays, but they didn't determine what it was. What's the best way to determine if it's cancer?**

 A. The best way, of course, is to have a reputable doctor examine her and follow through. There are various ways to investigate spots on the lungs. One method is bronchoscopy, which involves putting a tube down into the lung. There are various ways to operate to take a piece out. The piece is then sent to a laboratory and examined under the microscope this is a biopsy. There is a technique of utilizing a very fine needle to aspirate and obtain cells for diagnosis. This is called cytology and is similar to the concept of examining cells by the so called Pap technique. 

**Q. How do radiation physicists interact with the X ray technicians?** 

A. At Memorial, we work very closely with our radiation physicists. The Northeast Regional Physics Center has performed all of our work on mammography dosage. They are responsible for all of the therapy dosages and radiation control for all of the Northeast Center. They're very important in hospitals as they monitor all of the radiation exposures throughout the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I had a mastectomy over a year ago. Four years before that, I had belonged to a breast screening program. I had mammography, doctors examined me, and they never found a cyst or anything. The last examinations I had were only two months apart, and a lymph node was discovered. How is it possible that I went undetected by a doctor with all of my overprotectiveness?** 

A. When one goes through a screening program and has a mammogram, say, once a year and a breast examination by a physician, we are, at that moment, using all of the techniques that are available to us. It doesn't mean that a person has a clean bill of health for the entire year. There are certain breast cancers that will grow more rapidly than others. A person can be examined on one day, and six months later a cancer may develop and show up. The point is that you don't have a clean bill of health just because of one examination. However, we do find many patients in these examinations who do have a cancer. We are not 100 percent reliable with mammography. Your breasts are probably of the kind that is not ideal for mammography that is, a dense breast with very little fat in it. We're only about 90 percent accurate with these using mammography. We miss a [cancer](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=cancer) once in a while, and we feel terrible about it when we can't pick it up. But we just can't detect all of the breast cancers on a mammography, even as you can't feel all of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. I understand that thermography is not very effective in early detection either. You mentioned thermography earlier.** 

A. According to the American College of Radiology, the only time that the test is highly accurate is when it's too late and the patient already has advanced cancer. Thermography serves as a prescreening for many physicians to determine whether the patient should undergo mammography. The radiologists feel that patients who select thermography over mammography face the risk that a false sense of security imparted by a ""normal"" thermogram might preclude further study by mammography. But it is true that mammography is greater for accuracy in the older breast because its tissue is less dense. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Breast cancer operations carry an emotional trauma for women Are there any rehabilitative programs to help?** 

A. Yes. ""Reach to Recovery"" is one. It had been organized originally by the New York City division of the American Cancer Society. We arrange to teach women who have had a mastectomy to visit other women who have had mastectomies when they're in the hospital during the postoperative period. This program has been going on now for many years. In most institutions, it is fairly standard. The nurses on the floor call up the central ""Reach to Recovery"" agency, and a woman volunteer who has had a [mastectomy](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/2020/05/what-is-difference-between-radical-mastectomy-and-modified-radical-mastectomy.html) comes to the hospital and talks to the woman in her room, woman to woman. She also brings some literature and advises the patient in many ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. How successful is the GST test?** 

A. We are using GST really on an experimental research basis. It is not a test for cancer. It's just a physiological heat test of the breast. We hope that by monitoring a patient from six months to a year from year to year, we can detect some changes and decide how often a patient should have a mammography. It gives us the patient's baseline for comparison. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. For someone over 50 years of age who had several mammograms in the 1980s when dosages were high and several in the 1980s, plus a GI series, when could one expect that there might be a cumulative effect, and how long does one continue to take these mammograms? Does this go on endlessly?** 

A. We really have to make an educated guess. We are doing mammograms on women who have had as many as 10 or 12 mammograms, and I've never yet seen one that I could say had cancer from exposure to mammogram radiation. By the way, the GI series has nothing to do with mammographic exposure; they're two different areas. As you get to be over 50 and you're going into a natural high risk of getting breast cancer, you can't be afraid of the radiation when it might be the only thing that will pick up a cancer. You can't wait until you feel a lump. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Is it a definite fact that radiation is cumulative?** 

A. Not really. We just assume that it might be because some of the early studies added up to quite a sum. Breast cancer is more easily detected in women who are past 50 than in younger women who are, say, in their thirties, so if a woman is in her fifties, I would say continue with her mammograms. Now, because of better equipment and the extremely low [radiation](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=radiation) factor, women who are 40 to 49 are advised to get an annual or biannual examination. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Is the equipment you refer to standardized all over now?** 

A. Some doctors and clinics do not have up to date machines designed exclusively for mammography. Some may have them, but they are not properly maintained, and you must have top flight technicians to operate the machines. One has to be careful about a method used by some called xeromammography, which is not film mammography and involves a far higher X ray dose according to recent investigations. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. How serious is keratosis under the breast? I get it checked every six months, and they just say to leave it alone, but it irritates me.** 

A. If this is really a keratosis, it is something that is in the skin and not in the tissue of the breast itself, and it can occur on the [skin](https://www.medicalfightagainst-cancer.info/search?q=skin+cancer) anywhere in the body. If it just happens to occur on the skin of the breast, it is treated like any other keratosis. This thickening of the outer layer of the skin can be precancerous, but only about 20 percent are liable to become dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Q. Is estrogen for postmenopausal women dangerous?** 

A. Certainly, if the patient has had breast cancer, I would not recommend it. If the patient has not had breast cancer, I personally don't recommend it unless the woman has had severe postmenopausal symptoms that cannot be controlled by other measures. You can get statistics to support both viewpoints of using it and not using it."
CapableJellyfish2,1591507409,"When ever things are good with me something bad hapens. This time cancer. Right now I feel that I will most likely beat this just because shit would have stop hitting the fan regulary if I didn’t. (Doctor told me that with current knowledge me getting to be cancer free is over 90%)

But on the other hand I also know this will only my first ”real cancer”, ( had a lumb and other boob cut out at age of 19, no chemo or radiation needed) because at 25 I was diagnosed with li fraumeni.

So my odds getting a breastcancer were very high but I figured I would get myself masectomy? as 30th birthdaygift, as I tought I would have time because my sister (alive but with no cure) and mom (dead sice I was three) were diagnosed with breastcancer well in their thirties. So ofcource I just had my first round of chemo at age of 29.

It is Her 2+, nothing has shown up in lymphnodes and it has not show any hormone reactivity, I will know more afrer chemo rounds are done, I get surgery and doctors take a better look at the situatuon..

And finally ofcource this had to happen right now I had too many things going my way. I had just landed my dream in my dream company. We had finally saved up the downpayment and were trying to find the perfect home. We had discussed ivf possibilities with doctors to make sure I would not pass on this gene when we have kids.

I also just received my prescription for breast forms, so I’m thinking about getting adhesive forms to be able to wear a backless/low-back dress. How well does the adhesive work?

randomusername1919,1591478961,"So I was told if I had a mastectomy I wouldn’t need radiation....  well, now they are recommending radiation.  The radiation oncologist wants to compress four weeks of dose into three because of covid, and she spent a good bit of time telling me she didn’t think it would give me nerve damage.  Looking over the paperwork, the common side effects include chronic pain and loss of use of the arm - nerve damage is under the uncommon side effect list but I guess more of a concern because I will be cooked more since it is the same total dose, just in less time.  So it seems that the muscle damage, skin damage, and chronic pain are a sure thing since the dose rate is upped to make nerve damage a real possibility.  

Has anyone else gotten an “accelerated” course of radiation?  

I recently read an article about exercising after breast cancer and the article basically said that you would be told to exercise but you wouldn’t be able to do much of anything because you will age ten years, have chronic pain, and lose the use of your arm.  Not really encouraging, but tracks with the “side effect list” that they want me to sign off on saying I am ok with the risks and the doctor has explained them to me (she hasn’t, but that is another problem).

foryourbreast,1591468024,"Large-cell lymphoma associated with a breast implant (BIA-ALCL), a cancer of the immune system's T cells (not the breast itself), is a rare but serious complication.

Breast implants do not affect the risk of cancer, but increase the likelihood of developing a malignant tumor of the lymphatic tissue – anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. It is very rare, making up only 1% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, which, in turn, make up 4% of all types of malignant tumors.

Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is not characteristic of the breast. Most often, the tumor occurs in the lymph nodes and skin. But sometimes – in one operated woman out of 50 thousand-tumor cells appear in the scar around the implants.

The reasons for this complication are not fully understood. Studies have shown that lymphoma most often occurs after the installation of implants with a textured surface. They are often preferred because, unlike smooth ones, they are less likely to shift. But it turns out that an uneven surface causes a more violent reaction in the surrounding tissues, which can lead to a malignant tumor."

I don’t meet with the genetic counselor and surgeon until Monday because I am currently out of town. Thank you so much."
Lex_Loki,1591304190,"Ugh. I turned 30 a couple of months ago and joked about being ""old."" Now all the doctor says is how young I am. Life is a bitch sometimes. I thought I pulled a muscle in my neck about a month ago. Slept wrong or something. I could barely turn my head or raise my arm. After about a week and a half it went away. I was laying in bed, went to move, and felt something pull in my breast. I poke around and sure enough there is a massive lump. Weird. I ask my boyfriend to feel it. He dismisses it as a pulled muscle from my shoulder ""event."" I start googling. Left breast? Check. Upper outer quadrant? Check. Is it painful? Nope. Can you move it? Nope. CANCER. I immediately schedule an appointment with my gyno. She says how young I am and that it's probably a cyst or fibroadenoma. She feels the lump and her face changed a bit. ""I dont want to worry you, but were going to get you in for a diagnostic mammogram ASAP."" Wonderful. I google some more. Fibroadenoma. Should be mobile. Mine is not. Cyst, should be smooth and maybe squishy.  Mine is not. CANCER. 4 days later (today) I have my mammogram. I am the youngest person there. Even the receptionist is eyeing me. I have the mammogram. The sweet lady tells me how young I am and how common cysts are. She sees the images and stops joking around as much. She tells me I will need an ultrasound. Very routine. I have the ultrasound and can't help but look. There it was. Huge. Dark. Looks wavy. I think back to the cancer images I googled. CANCER. The ultrasound tech moves into my armpit. Starts snapping shots. I can't look any more. Lymph nodes. She tells me I can dress and she will be back with my results. She returns with a doctor. Fuck. The doctor sits down and sighs. She says in her years she hasn't seen many my age. She said she isn't for sure what it is, but wants it to be biopsied. I ask her what she thought. She can see my fear but is honest. ""I am worried. It could be an abnormal fibroadenoma, but I can't be sure."" She says if its cancer I will have a lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation and will move past all of this. I know she is trying to calm me down. Before she came in I googled. Cancer for 30 year olds is often more aggressive and the statistics are not in my favor. I am not a crier, but I broke down. She tells the ultrasound tech she wishes she could hug me. I wish she could too. So here we are on a Thursday. My biopsy is next Monday, with results likely by Tuesday. My son turns 5 tomorrow and his birthday party Covid style is Saturday. How do I explain losing my hair to a 5 year old? I am so scared of the results of the biopsy. I read I dont want triple negative. WTF is triple negative? I read I want stage 1. WTF is stage 1? I am very overwhelmed and told my boss, a breast cancer survivor, what is going on and that I would like to take a brief leave of absence. She is so sweet and understanding. A week ago my biggest worry in life was which bathing suit made me look skinny. Now I am worried about how long I might live. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. This is not a club I want to be in. But if my story and experience can help someone else, then I am happy to share. I will come back here when I get my results and update. My head is in a weird place right now, but I am hopeful."

DX on 4/3 last year
Double mastectomy 6/15
TC with Nulasta 4 rounds
Finished that with Zoladex and Emestane for 4 months but I couldn't do it. I took 6 weeks off and just started Tamoxifin two weeks ago.

I had a friend who had a hysterectomy and told me her hot flashes last ""a few seconds"" and she's able to go about her life otherwise with no issues.

I don't know anyone pre menopausal personally who has done this so I sincerely am not sure where to ask.

My ""hot flashes"" are like a 10 degree knock down to my tolerance of temperature. I used to keep my house at 75, and friends always joked I was ""cold blooded"" because I would wear long sleeve shirts home from the pool because I'd get chilly. 

Lately my thermostat is at 67 and I am still sometimes having to go stick my head in the freezer now and then to cool down. I can't golf anymore. It got to 80 last week and I played 3 holes and couldn't (between being overwhelmed with heat and ankle pain from the bone pain) go on.

Is this anyone elses experience? I'm not sure if I'm generally just uncomfortable in my body between some hormone mood changes and bone pain that I am temperature intolerant, or if this is genuinely temperature intolerance and I need to make some modifications to my lifestyle. The bone pain with this I'd like to the Nulasta week, it's quite painful and inconvenient but I'm trying to ignore it.

Right now I'm ready to say screw the Tamoxifin and screw it all and take my chances. Which is super stupid I'm sure? Or it's not. I don't know."

foryourbreast,1591300487,"However, do not expect an increase of 2-3 sizes. You can achieve the desired breast contour by increasing the volume of the small pectoral muscle, which is located directly behind the nipple. And if you stop training, then the result will also quickly come to naught.
To train the small pectoral muscle, you need to perform push-UPS from the bars in a straight body position. That's the way it is, and no other way. Otherwise, you will pump up the big pectoral muscle and get 2 Tits - your own and out of the muscle."

oatwolff,1591253794,"Hi everyone. Hope you can help. My mom was diagnosed with IDC (7 cm tumor, 3/4 lymphs, ER/PR+, HER2 -, grade 2) about a month ago. The diagnosis went from a lumpectomy and pills to surgery, chemo, surgery, radiation, pills. With Covid and currently living abroad I’ve had zero contact with the Doctors and my mom is overwhelmed when she speaks to the doctors that she forgets to asks many questions. Hopefully someone can help with some of my questions...

- the cancer was found in 3/4 lymph noids, the second surgery planned (after chemo), they will remove more. Am I correct in thinking that they do the second surgery to remove more lymph’s after chemo because if it has spread than the chemo might eradicate this? Also, does the cancer spread in some type of order therefore if it’s in 3/4 removed, is it less likely to be in more?

- She was diagnosed with Stage 2B (based on new grading) old grading would be stage 3A. They are in the process of running tests to see if it’s gone any where else. However, how do they diagnose stage before knowing this? 

- My moms been speaking to a lot of people and doctors but who has the one source of truth? Yesterday she has a call from the radiologist which we thought was a bit early (she hasn’t started chemo) and we believed the call would be to set up radiology appointments but instead the radiologist told her she was going to have a second surgery and to call her when that’s done. Is it normal that this is coming from the radiologist, shouldn’t her oncologist tell her this?

This whole experience has been surreal but on top of that very confusing. Hopefully I can find some light here. Thanks for your help"
YellowFeathers42,1591250588,"Hi, I (22F) posted here a little bit ago because I found a dimple on my left breast, which is only noticeable when I raise my arm. I just got an ultrasound and a mammogram, and they didn't find anything. My question is does anyone else know what it could be? They basically waved it off when nothing showed on the tests, and no one has given me any info on what would be the cause of the dimpling. There is no associated pain or lump, but underneath the dimple area it feels like there's a void in the tissue underneath. There is a distinct edge where the tissue near it drops off on one side, to the point that I'm not sure if it's a hole or if the area near it is just harder. My only other thought is fat necrosis, but that (according to google, which i know is awful, but its all i have rn) is supposed to have a lump, and it should have shown on the mammogram. Idk I just hate not knowing what it is. Does anyone know anything about this?"
searching_tau,1591244779,"Long story short, diagnosed with DCIS 2 different doctors had 2 different options.  One said lumpectomy and 30 sessions of radiation with tamoxifen.  The other said lumpectomy and the no estrogen pill, but had an alternative for radiation.  I was introduced to the SAVI and brachytherapy as a more focused alternative to traditional radiation.  I was also told about oncotype testing and this new DCISionRT test. I met with  a radiation oncologist who recommended it as well. Best part, they could use my existing biopsy sample! Well, this test determined that radiation would have NO EFFECT on my DCIS. 

Soapbox time, if I hadn't done this 2nd opinion I would have gone through 30 sessions of radiation on perfectly good tissue for nothing! Always follow your instincts and talk to every doctor you can until you feel good about one.

Penguins9022,1591172614,"This may be a very strange post but I’d figure I inquire about it anyways. About 20 min ago I was having a deep conversation with my boyfriend that turned from current events to the breast pain in my right breast. I grew concerned about it in the last few days as I’ve been getting really sharp pain there, but try to push it out of my head. 

I got curious tonight during our conversation and started doing a breast exam. I felt a little bump/lump on my right breast that hurt when I pressed on it. It’s important to note that I could feel lumps/bumps on my left breast but do not experience pain when I press on them. I’m embarrassed to admit that I’m not exactly sure how to differentiate between what could be a lump to what is just regular breast tissue as my breasts are on the smaller side.

Just as I was done doing the exam, my dog jumps on the bed with me an my boyfriend and stares at me very intently. I called him over to pet him so he comes over to my right and starts licking the same area on my right breast that I was concerned about. Right after that, my dog and I had a moment where we stared at each other for a while and he looked really concerned. He put his paw on me (I’m assuming for balance) and then laid right on top of me for a while. 

This could all be just a coincidence and I could be making something out of nothing, but is it true that dogs can sense something you can’t—like cancer? Do you recommend getting myself checked out? 

For some background: I am a late 20s female with a history of breast cancer in my family. Two aunts from my dad’s side passed away from it."
pugyoulongtime,1591166714,"I brought this up to my previous dr during a pap smear &amp; check up and she said it was probably nothing. She said the same thing about some stomach issues I had and I ended up having to get my gallbladder removed, so I'm a bit skeptical. I'm with a new dr now but everything is through the phone now with coronavirus so not sure if I can even get checked. The lump is painless and doesn't move, it's locked in place. It also seems to have gotten smaller but at its largest it was maybe the size of an eraser on a pencil? It's about half that now. I'm hoping it's nothing but I find it strange I've had this for about 2 years now. Any advice appreciated."

Gla55Haus8637,1591127449,"I (36F) was diagnosed with stage 3 metastatic breast cancer on July 22 of last year. It was extremely aggressive and was progesterone positive and HER2 negative.  I started my 16 sessions of chemo on August 9th and finally finished it January 3rd.  I had a double mastectomy in February,  started 30 sessions of radiation in March. I recently finished radiation in May and the next step is to get put on tamoxifen.  The usual time frame I've heard for people who have had breast cancer is 5 to 10 years, however my oncologist (who is amazing, listens and is upfront) said this may be for the rest of my life. 
I haven't technically become post menopausal however I haven't had a period since August of last year after my second chemo session.  

My questions for those who have gone through something similar would be...

1. What are the side effects you've experienced that weren't discussed or anticipated while on tamoxifen? 

2. How long and/or frequent were the side effects? 

3. What are alternative medicines to manage a reoccurrence of cancer?

4. How did the side effects affect your family dynamic?

5. How long were you on tamoxifen? 

6. What suggestions were given to curve the side effects?

I'm trying to figure out this new normal. Cancer is a rollercoaster that I didn't think I was going to ride and once I figure out one part, I get thrown for a loop. I want to prepare for the next steps needed to be deemed a survivor. Being BRCA2 postive means my odds of reoccurrence may be higher then others and that may mean my cancer rollercoaster won't stop as soon as I would like."
bcmx20,1591120706,"Hi everyone, I'm new around here and was glad to stumble upon such a supportive community. 2 weeks ago I noticed a large, firm lump under my right nipple that was incredibly tender. I waited about a week to be seen, thinking maybe it was something cyclical and would get at least marginally better, but it did not. I saw my gynecologist last week Thursday who assured me ""cancer is never painful and you're way too young to worry about that"" but referred me to a breast surgeon who could evaluate me for a fibroadenoma. I was told it may take up to a week for them to schedule me.

&amp;#x200B;

The breast surgeon called me a few HOURS later and said she would really like to see me the next day. I go in for my consult and, after having my gynecologist squash all my fears, this surgeon actually seems a bit nervous. I work in healthcare and can at least somewhat make out ultrasounds, and let me tell you, my lump looked ugly. 3 cm with irregular borders and the surgeon at this point said she was very concerned. She went to take a biopsy and found an infected fluid pocket in there so she took a sample and then the biopsy. She said she would call me the next day with my results, and she never did.

&amp;#x200B;

Today her office called and asked me to reschedule my follow-up appointment because the surgeon would like for me to have a longer appointment time than a regular follow up allows, but still has not let me know the results of my tests. I can only assume this is not good news. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to be patient and I realize 22 is young to have cancer. But I am dreading 2 more days of this anxiety. I am coming up on my 1 year wedding anniversary, just bought a house and adopted a dog, and live 12+ hours from family. Having a breast biopsy at the age of 22  is something I never expected. Fingers crossed that no news is good news, but it sure doesn't feel that way."

foryourbreast,1591082764,"Visiting an oncologist or mammologist is always an exciting event. And many women, having visited this doctor for the first time, are simply lost, forgetting to ask about urgent questions. And some moments are missed out of ignorance.

Today, I will not talk about specific complaints that women come to the mammologist with. And I will talk about 5 questions that you should check with your doctor when visiting.

*1. Is it True that breast cancer is getting younger?*

Here we are talking about the rejuvenation of Oncology as such, this is already a clinically proven fact: for 100 thousand women under the age of 30, 28.5 women are found to have breast cancer. By the way, breast cancer can occur even in adolescence and childhood.For example, the earliest age at which this cancer was registered was 8 years old.

Here we are talking about cancer rejuvenation on an individual basis. Let me explain - if a woman's mother had breast cancer, then she automatically falls into the risk group for this disease. And this woman should be examined not at the age when her mother was diagnosed with cancer, but 10 (!) years earlier. That is, if the mother had cancer at the age of 50, then the daughter should regularly visit a mammologist from the age of 40.

*2. Can breast cancer be detected by external signs?*

At the initial stage of breast cancer, no external signs are usually observed. You can only feel with your fingers a small knot in the thickness of the chest. But if you have any external changes, you should immediately visit a mammologist. Among them: hardening, retraction/erosion of the skin, burning/redness, discharge, wrinkling(orange peel), new bulges, bulging veins, retracted nipple, new asymmetry, skin tightness, internal tumor.

[Signs that require increased alertness are shown in this infographic, where lemons are given as an example](https://preview.redd.it/3k4ldbq78g251.jpg?width=1706&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c98cc46931aaa318ba215d80dda03ec98da901fc)

But once again, I emphasize that at the initial stage, cancer proceeds very ""quietly"", not manifesting itself until the process is sufficiently extensive.

*3. What time do I need to be examined?*

Few women take into account that there is an optimal period when the mammologist's examination will be most informative. We are talking about the menstrual cycle. The hormonal background strongly affects the tissues of the mammary glands. Therefore, the most optimal time for examination is considered to be the period from the 5th to the 10th day of the menstrual cycle. After the onset of menopause, this fact does not matter - you can be examined any day.

I'm talking about a ROUTINE checkup. But if you are worried about something, you do not need to wait for a certain day-you need to consult a mammologist as soon as possible.

*4. How good are the chances of a full recovery if breast cancer is detected?*

There are a lot of nuances in this issue. Of course, the determining role is played by the stage at which the cancer process was detected: 95% of all cases detected at an early stage were successfully treated before full recovery. If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, a woman has a high chance not only of a complete cure, but also of preserving the breast.

*5. Are there specific factors that cause breast cancer?*

The cancer process is influenced by many factors - Smoking and alcohol consumption, sunburn, late childbirth, early menstruation and abortion, stress, and hormonal imbalance. Most often, there is a conversation about the combination of risk factors and a woman's hormonal background. It sounds banal, but you need to take care of yourself and be examined in a timely manner."

1killertit,1591068267,"I'm 34 years old and just finishing up primary treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation, Kadcyla) for triple positive breast cancer. For the past couple months, my oncologist and I have been trying to find a hormone blocker that's going to work for me. Zoladex is out because it causes me extreme GI pain, to the point where I can barely move, and with Lupron I got to experience the joy of a week and a half of feeling like I could barely draw breath, followed by severe mood swings, paranoia, uncontrollable rage, and an appetite that's so suppressed I've lost ten pounds in the last three weeks. I can't be on either of these drugs for the next 5-7 years, which is what my oncologist is recommending, if that's how it's going to be. I'm also concerned about an elevated risk of reproductive cancers, as my grandmother had uterine cancer after menopause, so I'm considering getting everything taken out as I'm not having biological children anyway. 

What I'm most concerned about is whether the psychiatric side effects are going to be the same as the Lupron. I know that when the TCHP shut my reproductive system down back in September, I did not have any mental side effects at that time. My mood has been very stable and positive up until the goddamn Lupron shot. So, has anyone here had to go the oophorectomy/tamoxifen route, especially this long before natural menopause? What was it like for you?"

foryourbreast,1590857156,"Prompted to write this post u/mayonnaisemonarchy, which told how emotionally difficult it is for people with cancer to be asked to diagnose it in healthy people. In fact, this is a big problem for all of humanity - we are used to asking advice from people who can not help us due to lack of knowledge and skills, but whom we consider to be authorities for some reason. And professionals are often considered only from the point of view of Commerce-ha, if I ask the doctor, he will roll out a bill for 100 dollars, if I go to a specialized service, I will get a bill for minor repairs to my car for 150 dollars, and so on. In my first post on Reddit, I talked about creating a portable breast scanner that, thanks to bioimpedance, can accurately squeak whether you need to panic or not. The project is still in development, but if you want to participate in trial testing, you can leave requests on the site [https://www.portativebreastscanner.com/](https://www.portativebreastscanner.com/)

What do you say to that?"
mayonnaisemonarchy,1590852265,"Hi, mods you can remove this if you think it’s out of line. I’m a relatively new member of the subreddit because I haven’t had my cancer diagnosis for too long, so I don’t want to speak out of turn.

But, I’ve noticed a huge number of folks that come here basically asking us, as cancer patients, to diagnose them. I think it’s okay to ask for support, but I would also encourage people not to convince themselves they have cancer until a doctor tells you that’s the case. I am not a medical professional and I’m guessing that’s the case for a good number of folks here.

Also, please consider that when you ask a community of cancer patients/survivors to diagnose you when you don’t have cancer, you’re asking us to do emotional labor too. Again, I don’t want to speak out of turn, but cancer is exhausting in and of itself, at least for me.

Has anyone else noticed this?"
Darmono05,1590830353,"Hi there, I’m a 17 yo male from Minnesota. Umm as I’m kinda inexperienced to this, but for the past 2 weeks my right breast kept itching (but only when I’m going to bed and at night). There been changes to it to, the first notable one is that the breast look like it’s been cut or bruised( I can see like a pink like meat on my right breast) and occasionally when I shower it stung a bit(but only when I do morning shower) it stays like that for 2 weeks, on the first week I noticed that the skin was dry like I put some Vaseline on it and when I shower I can kinda peeled the dry skin. The next thing I notice is that it kept lactating a gooish yellow substance.
Umm I need your opinion on this matter as I’m still immature and my parents kept saying that it’s fine (to soothe me) but I kept panicking because I know male breast cancer is rare. So if anyone have any opinions or advice thank you so much I’ll appreciate it.

french-wannabe,1590715041,"Im not exactly sure how to describe the change in my right breast, except by saying that it almost looks like a dent. The “dent” is kind of crescent shaped and about 2” long and about 1” away from my nipple.

I noticed this dent like 4 day’s ago and it hasn’t changed or went away since then. I recently had surgery (3 1/2 weeks ago) to remove 3” from my 1st rib on the right side. To my knowledge, my breast wasn’t really touched during the surgery and the area of the dent is relatively farther from my surgical incision. I’m j wondering if this dent could be a result of the surgery and healing process, or if it is because of something else? I have an appointment w my gynecologist in a month, but I’m also wondering if I should be more worried and schedule an appointment for earlier/get this checked earlier?"
AquaWeenis,1590708437,"I am 37 years old, and was blindsided by a breast cancer diagnosis in January of this year. I was having some problematic back pain that wouldn't go away, and after an eventful trip to the ER and several scans, tests and biopsies later, my world came crashing down.

I was diagnosed with stage IV invasive ductal carcinoma - estrogen positive, HER2 negative, BRCA negative. The tumor in my left breast was undetectable by touch via two doctors, and wasn't discovered until the mammogram that followed. By then it had already metastasized to my spine and femurs. 

I am feeling pretty hopeless like my life is over. I am on oral hormone therapy meds, ovarian suppression shots, and bone strengthening infusions.  My tumors have shrunk since I started treatment in February, but I feel like this diagnosis is an early death sentence.

I have really been hesitant to jump into a forum like this, because sometimes reading about other people's experiences is too much to process. But I am wondering if anyone has had any promising outcomes/treatments with their stage IV journeys?  Feeling like I need a silver lining here."
julesfoxx,1590701607,"Hi everyone! Hopefully this is the right board to post in. My 55 year old mom was diagnosed with Stage 2 ILC. Right breast 2CM lump near armpit. Cancer was found only in 1 lymph node. Everything tested HER NEGATIVE and estrogen and progesterone positive. Her oncologist kept saying how treatable this is and reassuring us it will be ok! June 9 she will be getting a lumpectomy/ removal of some lymph nodes/ breast reduction/ and then radiation to follow. They have to see after surgery to see if she needs chemo. 

She just had a follow up call and now her oncologist is saying she needs all the lymph nodes removed in that armpit to make sure the cancer doesn’t spread. Is this normal?

If you’ve had all your lymph nodes removed in one arm, how is that effecting your life now


also, has anyone been givin this diagnosis before? What was your experience? Just trying to have a hopeful outlook and be completely prepared before June 9. Thank you so much everyone!"

wife_ilc_2020,1590694245,"My wife (43) felt a swelling/lump in upper part of right breast about 2 months ago. Once docs were opened back up (covid) she got a mammogram last week on Thursday, they did 2 and then an ultrasound. Biopsy next day of lump as well as lymph node.  


The diagnosis is ILC. I will try to transcribe the path report below...  


*Mass at 11:00 location, 5 cm from nipple, for a 55 mm mass lesion. Birads 5.*  


*Adenocarcinoma, infiltrating lobular type.*  
*Tumor grade 2*  
*Tumor size 10.1mm*  


*ER Positive, 60% strong*  
*PR Positive, 3-5% strong*  
*HER2 NEU (IHC) Negative (score 0)*  
*Ki67 Positive on 10-15% of tumor cells*  


*Glandular (Acinar) / Tubular Differentiation: Score 3*  
*NUclear Pleomorphism: SCore 2*  
*Mitotic Rate: Score 1*  
*Overall Grade: Grade 2 (Score of 6 or 7)*  


  
There are some other things on the paper but I understand none of this.   


They told us that the biopsy of the lymph node shows cancer cells, one had wall thickening and another looked like it might but they did not make a big deal of it.  


So we are scared but the surgeon today seemed upbeat and that made us feel a little better. Breast MRI tomorrow and some genetic testing thing next week.  


Anyone else have experience with similar diagnosis? We probably want to talk to another doc before we go too far, not because we dont trust who we are seeing right now but just to get a feel if someone else might approach this differently."

diamondserpent,1590636202,"23f. No family history of breast cancer. Over the past two months (I’ve been very stressed), I’ve noticed changes in my breasts (left breast more than right).

The changes did involve pain and aching and they have been cyclical, and when I went to my GP she said that I definitely had some fibrocystic breast tissue when she did the exam.

The problem is that I’ve noticed a few lumps that weren’t there before, and I’m not sure if that has to do with the fibrocystic development or if it’s something else. The main one is on the lower side of my left breast. It’s the most prominent one, it doesn’t feel like a ball, but I can feel for it. That area was also where there was pain and I’m wondering if it’s a cyst bc the pain was cyclical. I’m very worried and I wanted to ask, can I sidestep my GP and go straight to a gynecologist? I’ve never been to an OBGYN so I don’t know if I can.

It’s starting to drive me crazy and this whole quarantine has made my anxiety worse so I don’t know what to think and I hope I’m not overthinking.

My grandmother beat it twice and her sister died from it. The other night I was putting on lotion and I felt a lump in my right breast on the outer upper side... I compared it with my other breast and also made my sister feel it just incase I was being over dramatic. I then found a second, smaller lump in the same breast. Afterwards I called my grandma and talked about what it was like for her when she was first diagnosed. She told me about the nipple discharge she had that originally made her go get checked out. I immediately lightly squeezed my right breast and there was discharge, quite a bit of it too. Then I realized that I had seen it before but I had assumed it was dead skin and didn't realize it was dried fluid... When I checked out my other breast there was nothing. no discharge, no lumps, no discomfort... every thing on that boob feels just fine. So obviously I'm a bit worried.

Last year my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. I am very grateful to say she is now cancer free! She has two silicone implants and has slowly become more comfortable with her body. Anyway, now that the weather is warming up her and I (19F) will often go swimming in our pool. However, my mom is becoming increasingly frustrated with her bathing suits. She says that nothing fits her right anymore and she is very uncomfortable in them now that she has implants. I want to help her find new bathing suits that she is comfortable in, but I have no idea where to look. It seems like every place we have tried just don't have styles that work well with her implants. 

So am I wondering if anyone has any recommendations on what stores/brands carry clothes, specifically bathing suits, that are very adjustable and/or can be worn with breast implants. Thank you all so much!"

daphne1201,1590460199,"Hi everyone. I’m 24 years old, currently live in a city away from my family. I found a painful lump in my left breast, under the bottom half of my nipple on May 12th and quickly went and got referred to get an ultrasound done. So Wednesday I’m having a consultation with a surgeon about a biopsy. 

In the ultrasound, they found a couple of blood vessels floating around as well as the lump and in my tizzy of hearing the results I didn’t ask what the blood vessels being present actually means. 
The lump is painful and I think has gotten bigger since I noticed it. It’s annoying to sleep because it seems like no matter how I lay the bump hurts.

I guess I’m just afraid. My dad had breast cancer last year (luckily is doing great now!) and my mom died from cervical cancer. I’m afraid of dealing with this on my own. I have some great friends but, I don’t know, this is a lot. The not knowing is literally the worst part right now. I’m trying to put a hard stop on the googling because I’m just freaking myself out further. 

Any tips about questions to ask the surgeon before the biopsy? What did you do to distract yourself from the waiting between appointments?"

silence4713,1590380861,"Okay so I’m hoping to get in to see a doctor this week, but I’ve had to hold off due to a potential Covid exposure. A little over a month ago I discovered a large boil/pimple on my left breast right beneath the aureola. It was raised and swollen and had a tiny pinhead size white head. I also discovered a marble sized lymph node swollen at the very top of my left armpit, right at the edge of the hair growth. It was hard and red and hurt. I know I’ve gotten similar bumps in my arms before, usually in that spot, but I couldn’t say for sure which arm. I had some breast pain surrounding the “boil” which was inflamed for about a week before it popped and the small amount of white pus came out. Then the boil flattened and developed a white crust. A few weeks later that crust flakes off and left a small open cut, and now what’s left of the boil is a small purple spot the size of pin, flat and slightly painful. But now my whole breast is experiencing pain. It feels like bruising, mostly on the inner and outer side. The original lump in my armpit has decreased tremendously and is now flat, but can still be felt, and two more have popped up, still on the edge of the arm pit hair, but closer to my inner arm, one hard and visible, the other which is on top of that 2nd one feels like a tiny inflamed pimple. I am in my early 30s but do have a family history of great aunts and a grandmother with breast cancer. Haven’t been able to find a definite lump, but I think the glands of my left breast feel slightly larger than the corresponding glands I find on my right. I also am finding some slight skin peeling or white skin flaking on the left breast beneath the boil, but it’s so slight that I don’t know if it could be a reaction to bandaid I had over the boil a few weeks back, or to me constantly messing with my breast to try to and get a look at the skin changes or feeling for lumps. Is there anything this could be besides cancer? I keep thinking that if it is cancer it’s probably already in my lymph nodes and there is very little hope left."

No serious side effects with leronlimab in over 800 patients they did on their HIV trials.  Leronlimab is also being studied for COVID-19 and showing incredible results.

I’ve never posted in here before (or anywhere) but just had some questions about symptoms. I have random pain in my left nipple that I usually say is due to my period because I have AWFUL PMS. this past period I noticed a very slight crust on my nipple. It just looked like little pieces of salt almost but where darker. I could clean them off and everything. 

I’ve done a lump check but don’t notice anything unusual. I’m an A or AA cup so my breast are tiny and I can feel my breast bone through them. I had a telehealth appt with my doctor about my period and she checked out my breast and didn’t seem TOO concerned. She said this could just be an over production or prolactin and to get blood work. I’m terrible at doing bloodwork and I pass out every time so I’m waiting a little until I can bring someone with me due to COVID.

1. Can breast cancer be TINY, smaller than a pea? Is that much more likely to be something else? 

2. Can cancer cause implant rippling? They are 3 years old with no prior problems. 

3. Is there any way a diagnostic mammogram can look at area in between breasts? 

I found a hard fixed spot on the upper outer quadrant of my right breast about 6 weeks ago. It is very, very small but definitely there and my husband can feel it also. No pain or changes at all. I waited through a period just to make sure. I'm going in next week for a diagnostic mammogram because I have a family history. I also have some softer lumps, flatter and closer to quarter size on my breast bone/sternum in between my breasts that have grown very slowly over the last 9 months. Not sure if they're related but leads me to the second part...

I got implants 3 years ago after having several fibroadenomas removed and was left very uneven. One of them just started rippling and my surgeon suggested doing a thorough exam before coming to see her to get a  revision to make sure there werent any underlying issues so my second question,

2. Can cancer cause implant rippling?

imacatsrsly,1590184232,"Hi everyone. I posted a week or so ago about being done with chemotherapy. I guess I'm just sort of venting here / looking for reassurance. I met with the surgical oncologist today and he reviewed my MRI with me etc... He recommended a mastectomy vs a lumpectomy because of the size of my breast and the amount of tissue he would have to remove if he just did a lumpectomy. Also the cancer was sort of throughout my entire breast in different spots. I totally agree with him. I like this surgeon and trust him. Unfortunately, I won't be able to have a nipple sparing mastectomy because some of the cancer is literally right behind my nipple. I'm sad about this but also relieved to know what the plan is. I'll be having a skin sparing mastectomy with reconstruction (implant). Does anyone have an experience with this sort of surgery? Any suggestions for ways to help the scar heal as best as I can? Advice on implants or what to expect pain / sensation-wise? I don't like the plastic surgeon as well as I'd hoped and it's making me nervous about the outcome of the reconstruction part..."
fiftyshadesofroses,1590174724,"I was diagnosed with DCIS in 2011. I was 27, uninsured and it was caught literally by accident. I had a cyst that I'd found during my monthly self-exam, went to a local sliding scale clinic, was brushed off, asked for a referral, a dear friend who is now deceased paid for me to see an Oncologist who was willing to do a needle biopsy after an ultrasound, which my friend also paid for. The biopsy found ""a few cells"". I asked if watchful waiting was a possibility (student, part time employment, no insurance and was  homeless and couch surfing.) was told that I could do that, and started doing mammos when I got insurance a few years later after college. So far, so good.

I feel like a damn idiot that I did not get any of the pathology reports or keep the medical records. But, when you're homeless....anything is hard to keep hold of. I do have a very heavy family history of breast and ovarian cancer, and my sister had a mastectomy by the time she was 35 as a result, and she's BRCA positive. That was a big reason why I freaked out when I found the lump that I did.  I am not (finally had genetic testing done in 2016). 

My primary doc has me doing a MRI and a Mammogram once a year, separated by 6 months, but I started seeing a gynecologist for my annual well woman visits this year  especially as I've had some recent issues with my monthly cycle. The gynecologist strongly suggested that I see a breast specialist, so I'll see her on June 3rd.  

I am not even sure HOW to explain my situation and history to the specialist without sounding like an idiot. I've had a mammogram + ultrasound every year since 2015 and a Breast MRI each year since 2018. I can easily get the films and reports from those. My reports have stated BIRADS-2 after each mammogram. 

Tl;dr: DCIS in 2011, but no records from then because homeless. Now have good medical care, history of imaging and am seeing a specialist in June to make sure that I'm not supposed to be doing something other than just doing the annual monitoring.

 Question for the sub: Not sure what questions/information to ask/five the specialist. I was told that they'd obtain any films or reports that can be found, so I was just going to attend the appointment and take it from there. 

Does that sound reasonable? 

Thanks."
jfkecaz,1590158009,"Hey there, I am gonna try to be as brief as possible.

I am 20 yo male. I have been suffering from small eczema for a long time. Usually they are on my hands. The treatment with traditional ointments hasn't been very successful. I eczema usually goes worse during spring (which is now) due to my pollen allergy (it is somehow connected). I also have to admit that I am obese and suffer from average gynecomastia.

Approximately 4 months ago my right nipple started itching a bit. I thought that it is just another part of my eczema. I was surprised that it went to the nipple but I didn't see any problem. For a 3, almost 4 months I have been experiencing slight itching on that nipple, probably every second or third day. I always use some average moisturizing creams, it reliefs from itching but doesn't really heal.  Sometimes I also experience very little peeling skin on my right (unhealthy) nipple.

I feel no pain and I have found no lump anywhere. Only the itching and skin peeling.

Those are the symptoms:

* Itching or a burning sensation in the nipple and/or areola
* Pain and sensitivity
* Flattening of the nipple
* Yellow or bloody discharge from the nipple
* A lump in the affected area
* Only one breast affected

Out of these I only suffer from the first and the last.

Only itching.. And the right unhealthy nipple is also a bit bigger right now. You can see that on the photos. BTW I am sorry you have to watch fat man's nipple..

I am planning to go to the doctor next week because I am scared but I would like to know your opinion. At first, it sounds like I am an hypochondriac idiot who has just a little eczema, on the other hand, I am just really scared. Thank you for your opinions.

MommalovesJay,1590136646,"I haven’t really told anyone about what I’m going through. But I would really appreciate some advice. So a couple months ago I found a lump in my breast. My SO and I examined it and assumed it was a cyst, but he convinced me to get it checked out anyways. I see my Dr and he sends me to get a mammogram saying it’s probably a cyst but we wanna make sure. 
So I go in like okay this is easy breezy. The mammogram shows that it’s not a cyst, but could just be a fibrocystic breast. To be safe I get scheduled for a biopsy. 
Then is when I’m getting anxiety. I rescheduled twice because of anxiety and with covid going on. Finally I go in a month later. So much anxiety. I’ve never gotten anything close to surgery before. Biopsy was done two weeks ago. My Dr called me yesterday to go in so he can talk to me. 
I worried that it was a bad sign. My SO reassured me that he’s sure it’s just protocol. For me it was like if it’s good they would just tell me over the phone. I went in today and he told me that my biopsy was inconclusive. I would be scheduled to see a breast surgeon. 

My questions are: Has anyone else has an inconclusive test and everything went well and turned out to be nothing? Do a lot of people come back from biopsy with inconclusive results? 
Were there any symptoms besides the lump? 

I’m 32. Fairly healthy. Finally cried today after getting my inconclusive results. I don’t want to freak my friends and family out so I have no one to talk to."
blu_butterfly,1590111005,"Part of the clinical notes is the referral reads ‘non painful, on examination is deep, tethered to underlying structures in the upper outer quadrant axillary line, firm nodule of about 2cm diameter’

The tethered part scared me. Do benign lumps tether or fix to skin or muscle?

I found this lump about 4 weeks ago but we were in strict lockdown so I decided to wait until doctor visits for non urgent stuff were allowed. They are still not doing face to face appointments unless necessary so I had a video consult first and then was asked to come in for a face to face. After examination of both breasts, my doctor couldn’t feel the lump and I had to show her where to find it. It’s that deep and I don’t have big breasts.

I’m feeling anxious but am almost numb from the worry. I haven’t cried, I’m calm but I’m silently freaking out. I’m a single mother of 2 kids and worry what this might mean for me.

I guess I’m just looking for some words from people who have gone through similar and maybe a glimpse of hope that this might be a benign issue.

Thanks all"
nevalstak,1590085283,"Hi all,

About 2 weeks ago I discovered that I have bloody discharge that can be expressed from one duct in my left breast. I then did a self exam and found a hard, movable pea size lump.

I saw my doctor yesterday and she confirmed she felt it and also felt a couple other spots she wanted to get checked out so she ordered an ultrasound. I also told her that for years I’ve been able to express some sort of discharge from both breasts so she also ordered a blood test to check my prolactin levels.

I just finished with my ultrasound and they said they couldn’t find anything. That they’ll tell my doctor and she can decide what to do next if she’s still concerned.

I guess I’m frustrated that they couldn’t see it and wondering what my next steps should be? Them saying everything is ok because they couldn’t see it doesn’t exactly give me peace of mind.

I’m young and I know the odds are in my favor, but I also know that this lump was never there before and bloody discharge isn’t normal either."
Chloemom08,1590071917," Hello, Ladies! It is such an encouragement to be here. On April 17, 2015, I was diagnosed with late stage 3 breast cancer (triple positive) at age 25. The past five years have been full of treatments. Now, I'm cancer-free and wanting to give back to the cancer community. I'm writing a book about young breast cancer survivors. If you are or were under age 50 when diagnosed, would you mind sharing with me what your recovery has been like (mentally, physically, emotionally, etc) through this quick survey. All information is strictly confidential. I'd love to hear your feedback. Thank you!

balatonfured,1590047679,"Hi all,

Could you share your experiences right after mastectomy and reconstruction with me? How many days did you spend in the hospital? What range of motion did you have during this time? How did you feel during this time? Did you feel pain, anywhere swollen, etc?

When you got home, what were the first week like? How did you feel? What could make your recovery at home smoother?  

My mom went through unilateral mastectomy and reconstruction yesterday. I’m in a different country so I’ve only had two one-minute calls with her post surgery. She said she is in a lot of pain and is ordered to be bedridden for the next 3 days, can barely chew because chewing stretches her neck muscle and causes pain, catheter, no moving the neck and definitely no moving of the arm on the side of the operation, no shower. 

The past few weeks have been a whirlwind for me. I’ve been googling for information. I also bought some books on breast cancer and reconstruction and started reading them. 

However, I only see description of patient experiences weeks, months or years after the surgery. I would really love to understand my mom’s feelings now, see what’s reasonable and what’s excessive pain, perhaps to help me lessen my worry and stress.

Thank you!"

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic BC in February with mets to her liver and lungs. She was prescribed palbociclib + letrozole and oncologist had  given her approx 1 year to live.

Today, we found out that the cysts in her liver have continued to grow so the oncologist has now prescribed Fulvestrant in place of letrozole. Shes now been given approx 6 months if the Fulvestrant doesnt work. 

Would anyone be able to tell me what the difference between these two endocrine therapies is? And if possible what the response rates are like? I've done my research but it's tough to navigate and fully understand the studies and journals.

Frost_Goldfish,1589913096,"Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this short and to avoid detailed information for privacy reasons.

My best friend was initially diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago in her late twenties. She went through chemo, surgery, radiotherapy. It was bad. Large aggressive tumor, poor response to chemo, cancer in her lymph nodes.

A few years passed since the diagnosis, she is now in her early thirties. She was taking hormonotherapy and started reconstructive surgery. But a few days ago she sought out medical attention for severe back pain and there it was. The cancer has come back, it has metastasized to a bone.

I know this means it can't be cured. Nobody knows exactly how long she might still live. Hopefully, it's years rather than months. But it won't be enough years, and it will be challenging ones. I have worked with oncologists and palliative care providers so I have some inkling of what's next, in theory anyway.

I don't think I need to say how terrified and heartbroken I am. We have been friends for a long time and I always expected we would be friends until death did us part, but I pictured us having white hair and grand-children by then. Yet it also appears to me that those months or years are so incredibly precious. They are all we have left.

I know everyone is different and what's ""supportive"" to one person might be unwelcome for someone else. Still, I'm willing to hear about anyone's experience, hear about what was the most helpful to you or to a loved one you supported, or get video/books suggestions... What have you.

I apologize if this is not an appropriate post for this subforum, I genuinely looked for rules/a FAQ and couldn't find any."
Whiskey_sunflower,1589906171,"So, I'm 29 and was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, HER2 negative, estrogen receptors at 50%, progesteron negative, and Ki67 is at 85%. Was stage 2, only in one place in my left breast, but looks like it has spread within my breast and one lymph node (the MRI results showed that).
My mum first got breast cancer when she was only 28, got it again in the other breast at 39 and died a year and a half later (inflammatory breast cancer). I was genetically tested and am waiting for the results. I've already started EC chemo, next round is in a few days, 8 cycles, 2 weeks apart. Then surgery after chemo. 

I'm really struggling. In my effort to not let this define me I feel like it has consumed me... every thought has been about cancer and everything that awaits me. I've been crying a lot. Most conversations with my friends have been about this because I have nothing else to say... nothing else going on in my life. I have no family, it was just me and my mum, then she passed. I had a partner for over 10 years, we lived together, but that fell apart and I've been living in a wonderful foreign country in the EU, in a very small town for 6 months now, I do have a few amazing friends here and a great job that I love... but my work is physical, construction, and after the first chemo I stayed home for a week, just had no strength in me whatsoever. I can get fully paid sick leave, no problem, but I don't want to go on sick leave, not yet. 

I'm fiesty and have inner strength, at least I used to be like that but now... I just feel like I'm spiraling out of control. 
I don't know what I want, I know I want to live as normal as possible, but it bothers me if people act 'normal' as though I'm not sick, but it also bothers me when it's all they talk about... I'm afraid of being abandoned by my friends, their lives will go on, they'll be making plans and going on vacations... and I'll be doing chemo and then surgery. 

I feel like I've become needy, not giving people space to breathe, I've been overreacting to things and being overly emotional... and I don't know how to stop and get my head on straight. 

How did you cope? How did you live with this and be okay?

The bleeding was pulsating and basically have found that I can “milk” the blood out of my breast. I called a breast specialist about a week or so ago and got a Telehealth appointment yesterday. In the time between the call and appointment I found a pea, hard lump about an inch away from my nipple. I have been in really bad pain the last few days, and I find it uncomfortable to lay on either side especially without a looser bra on. The breast specialist is trying to get me in for an ultrasound and in person appointment for tomorrow, but Im waiting for a call. I barely slept last night between pain and worry.

foryourbreast,1589884762,"Hello everyone!

So I became a member of Reddit)  

Recently I came across such statistics - every 8 women die from breast cancer, and if the disease was detected at an early stage, the woman can be cured.
However, breast cancer is rarely checked and only in women over 35 years of age, and in the current time, cancer has often appeared in women younger than 28 years.

And I have a question, dear readers, whether it would be interesting to have a pocket device that could show online, without going to the doctor, whether everything is OK with your Breasts or you need a detailed diagnosis?"

**Returning to work after cancer: what can employers do to help?**

How can workplaces help their employees return to work after cancer treatment? What are the key factors that help or hinder this process? 

Researchers at Deakin University are conducting a study that hopes to find answers to these questions, in order to help support survivors and workplaces with the return to work process.

The study involves completing an online survey asking about different work-related factors (e.g. HR policies, communication, colleague support) at the time of diagnosis and on returning to work. The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.

**Who can take part?**

If you have been diagnosed with cancer in the past 5 years, were in paid employment when you were diagnosed, and are over the age of 18, you can take part in this study.

Whether you ended up changing jobs, retiring, or staying with the same employer, if you were working at the time of your cancer diagnosis, this survey is for you!

Participation is completely voluntary and your survey responses are completely anonymous. 

**Who is doing the research?**

The study is being conducted by a team of researchers at Deakin University which includes two Master of Organisational Psychology students. The students are undertaking this project as part of their studies. This study has received Deakin University ethics approval (ethics reference: HEAG-H 182\_2019). 

**How can I access the survey?**

Laziness_supreme,1589785852,"My mom had her double mastectomy for IIA triple negative IDC in early April. Unfortunately she didn’t get a complete pathological response with three small tumors (5mm, 3mm, 2mm) remaining so she was supposed to start Xeloda (Capecitabine) last Wednesday, no radiation because of COVID. After her morning dose she started experiencing a few side effects, namely a tightening in her chest and numbness in her tongue, that she decided to tough out. I was finally able to talk her into calling her doctor before she took her evening dose and her doc told her to discontinue immediately and sent a referral for a cardiologist. She also received strict instructions to go to the hospital if any new symptoms arose. It’s now Monday and though the tightening is less severe it’s still present, and it’s got her wondering what the next step would be if she can’t continue Xeloda. Have any of you experienced this? Did you switch to another oral chemo or was it just the end of the line treatment wise? She’s really just trying to see what to expect after this new bump in the road."
irishsaint80,1589755440,"Hi, my wife had single mastectomy mid March which was successful. Her biopsy score came back as 41 which we were told was pretty high so a course of act chemo was recommended.

She also suffers from allergy asthma and esophagal webs. Basically she chokes every time she tries to eat something.  Both of these have been much worse in the last week. She started her chemo Monday gone and isn't due back for another week.

Is being short of breath something that would normally come from chemo?  Its a massively steep learning curve."
mca360,1589753082,"Hi there-

Throwaway account here for obvious reasons. I've cross posted this on the ask doctors subreddit and am looking for feedback. I've been in touch with a doctor already and will call my PCP tomorrow.  

White male, 28, very healthy and exercise regularly, slightly high intake in alcohol but not wildly out of line with recommended amounts per week. I am very on top of my health and get regular blood work and quickly investigate anything that seems out of the ordinary.

\-------

About four days ago, I noticed that the area near my nipple felt a bit sensitive/tender. I am very much aware that men can get breast cancer, and being a bit of a hypochondriac, I felt around my whole breast area thoroughly. Despite a bit of tenderness, there was no lump or any thickening of the tissue in that area at all. I woke up the next day and there was redness only in that region - above my left nipple, slightly on the ride side. The area was still sensitive, still no lump.

The day after that, I woke up, the redness was pretty much gone (a tiny localized bit still exists but it had definitely decreased from the day before). However, I definitely noticed a thickening of the tissue above my nipple at this point.

Today, there is still a touch of redness, but only right over the area where the skin felt to be tightening a bit. There is now a pea-sized lump in that area, and it has remained sore and tender.

So right now, there is tenderness or soreness in the area , a pea sized lump that is very easy to feel, and a bit of redness but only right above where the lump is. There is a touch of swelling too, but nothing significant. Otherwise no apparent symptoms such as fever or itchiness.

I did a telemedicine visit this morning for peace of mind, and the doctor suggested it was infection from possibly a bug bite, abscess, or ingrown hair. I don't see any indication of that superficially, and redness has also definitely decreased. The doctor told me to wait until tomorrow and if its not much better, then begin a course of antibacterial antibiotics such as Bactrim. He also suggested I do heat compresses on the area which I have been doing.

I am worried however that this is something a bit more sinister, such as male breast cancer, and am playing out tons of worrying scenarios in my head. I realize that male breast cancer is rare, and to get it at my age would be almost an anomaly, but I've done my research and there are few (very few, actually) cases of men my age having it. But I certainly have a few of the symptoms- lump (albeit a painful one), redness, and some swelling.

What I am trying to justify, if it is indeed a cancerous ailment, is how quickly this all started. And that it was immediately painful, which seems abnormal to breast cancer based on research I've done. No family members, male or female, have had breast cancer except for one great grandmother who is long-deceased from other causes.

Anyway, I would love to hear suggestions, as this is stumping me quite a bit, and is very worrying. I am going to call my PCP tomorrow morning, first thing. I believe she is also only doing tele-medicine at the moment, though, so I'm not sure how helpful that will be for something like this. I will discuss with her either way.

Thank you in advance for reading and for any advice, opinions, or feedback."
lazyMarthaStewart,1589752774,"During my lumpectomy, ~3 wks ago, several lymph nodes were also removed from my armpit. I know tenderness is normal. My arm feels absolutely bruised, but without discoloration or swelling... really tender. I know ibuprofen is ok if it's bothering me, and usually it doesn't unless I touch it. It mostly only hurts to the touch. Like, hurts to wash my hands because of touching that side. Anyway, my question is whether I should ice it, or not. Should I rub/ lightly massage it, or not? Prop it up, or is ignoring it the best bet? Is there something that has worked for others?  Thank you for any advice you have."
freaknastyxphd,1589748575,"wife chose to have a double mastectomy, they also removed all of the corresponding lymph nodes.    


two questions - 

one of the drain bulbs has some blood in it that has 'clotted'.  i have tried to use 91% alcohol squirting it into the bulb and then massaging the bulb.  also tried leaving about 20 (whatever units we are counting) units of alcohol in the bulb overnight to see if it would dissolve the 'clot' but whatever is left isnt going anywhere.  i suppose this is not to be worried about?

&amp;#x200B;

secondly, the doctor said that she might lose some functionality of her right arm (this was the side that the cancer was located), are there any excersizes or whatnot that might improve her chances to keep as much functionality as possible?  


oh, and the kicker, when we went in for the followup, 2 days after a 6-7 hour surgery, she was told that she might have gotten mrsa in the hospital and she is on an additional antibiotic.

erinyslyric,1589719562,"Hi, first time poster and all that jazz.  My mum (64) was diagnosed with breast cancer 18 years ago (Estrogen Receptor Positive). Three lumpectomies, a mastectomy/rebuild, and a burst of radiotherapy treatment, and she was in remission. Tamoxifen to reduce regrowth and she was fine for years.

Then, during a routine scan three or so years ago, they found mets on her lungs and liver. Completely asymptomatic, but they started chemo. It worked. The mets shrank, she came off chemo, and after a nightmare of allergies, they found a combo of meds that helped, and another year went by. Late last year, they found the mets were growing again. More chemo, more meds, more success. Up until a couple weeks ago.

She couldn't walk most of the time, balance issues. She couldn't talk properly. My dad, who has been the only one leaving the house since isolation kicked in, couldn't leave her alone. She was making random phone calls, shouting nonsense at people. When she was walking, she kept falling.

They went to the hospital and did a cat scan. Metastatic brain cancer. Steroids helped her get back to normal, while they figured out next steps. Doctor came out, targeted radiotherapy, while the specialists looked into the mets. 2 sessions, and that was all they could do. We were expecting just under a year.

I spoke to my dad yesterday. Best case scenario is 4 months. Worst case is a few weeks. Weaning her off the steroids will give them a better idea.

When I was told it was in her brain, I cried, a lot. But I still had hope, because there was a plan. There was time. I stopped crying. I think I forgot for a while that once it hits the brain, it's pretty much hopeless. But now? Now that I have a timeline, and know what's left? I haven't cried.

I feel like I should be upset. I mean, I'm sad, but I'm not crying. Which is unusual for me. I normally cry at the drop of a hat. Hormones, sad movies, sad books, anything. But... I wonder if I'm broken, or I'm in shock, or....something. I don't know.

I don't know why I'm writing this here, other than I don't know where else to go. Thanks for listening, keep strong, and stay safe."

sativasadie,1589693465,"Hello all

I'm not sure where to start, let me try to be as thorough as possible here...

At 43, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She's 55 now, and she beat it. Just over a year ago, her mother (my maternal grandmother) was diagnosed. I believe she has a few more treatments left but it keeps getting bumped around and switched, but her treatments are more precaution than anything else. HER mother, my great grandma, also had breast cancer, but little is known about it.

On my dad's side of the family, his mother passed away from breast cancer that spread through her body when my dad was in his teens. Other family members of his have had it, including his sister (my aunt). I don't know this family well so I'm fuzzy on details. I do know my aunt has beat it.

Both my mom and my aunt have been tested for the gene and neither of them carry it.

At my last appointment at the cancer clinic my only option given to me was to get regular mammograms starting now (this was immediately before this pandemic, and I hadn't started prior because I was nursing my baby until late last year).

I'll be 35 in a few months, that's creeping up to the age my mom was when she was diagnosed. My daughter is just about 2. 

At this point, I feel like it's an inevitable diagnosis for me and I don't want to put my family through that. Has anyone been in this position? Has anyone considered, decided against, or gone through with a preventative double mastectomy?

Thanks for reading. Please be kind."
passingby_2,1589691772,"recently  I have had an abortion at 5weeks, but on top of that I have started  using a new laundry detergent (cheer).. So I'm a little confused as to  what might really be causing this.

I  think about a week ago I started seeing dryness/flaky skin on my nipple  which was later accompanied by itchiness. I dismissed this thinking it  was probably just due to the pregnancy hormones and whole expansion of  glands.

But today my breasts and  just inferior to my breasts there is redness and they're itchy very  often. I looked up symptoms and I'm thinking it might be IBC though, I  dont have pitting or inverted nipples. But the itchiness/redness is  affecting the area anterior but medial to my elbow. So it is also making  me think it might be some kind of rash.

Which  has led me here to ask if anyone has experienced symptoms like this as  well and later on diagnosed? also, does IBC itchiness/redness work in a  way that spreads to different parts of the body?

Budget_Impression,1589676362,"I’m 37 and have been having left nipple pain during my period for several months. I didn’t think a thing of since it cyclic. Well after doing som digging I found a mass behind my nipple. It’s a round ball, moveable and feels like a gland. I checked my right breast and have a gland like that in the same spot but it’s much smaller. What would cause it to enlarge? Can it be from me constantly poking at it? I have a mammogram and ultrasound scheduled and I’m freaking out. Anyone else had something similar to this?"
passingby_2,1589675202,"Hi all, I'm 23F

Recently I have had an abortion at 5weeks, but on top of that I have started using a new laundry detergent (cheer).. So I'm a little confused as to what might really be causing this. 

I think about a week ago I started seeing dryness/flaky skin on my nipple which was later accompanied by itchiness. I dismissed this thinking it was probably just due to the pregnancy hormones and whole expansion of glands. 

But today my breasts and just inferior to my breasts there is redness and they're itchy very often. I looked up symptoms and I'm thinking it might be IBC though, I dont have pitting or inverted nipples. But the itchiness/redness is affecting the area anterior but medial to my elbow. So it is also making me think it might be some kind of rash. 

Which has led me here to ask if anyone has experienced symptoms like this as well and later on diagnosed? also, does IBC itchiness/redness work in a way that spreads to different parts of the body? 

Any feedback would be appreciated, thank you."
Alphabetasouper,1589659138,"Hi all! I finished treatment three years ago and was declared NED 3.5 years ago from inflammatory breast cancer stage 3c at age 34. I went through the gauntlet of treatment, but have been NED since February 2017. My period returned after my herceptin treatment ended and has been regular since. However, this last cycle was heavier than norm and I started having hot flushes about 3-5 times a day. They’re not horrible- not at all like they were during treatment, but definitely uncomfortable. My question is: could I possibly be starting early menopause at 38years even though my period returned after chemo? Has anyone had this happen or know if chemo can have this effect years later?"
mayonnaisemonarchy,1589634022,"Hi there. As the post says, I just got the call yesterday. I'm honestly still very shocked and sad. I have no family history and I feel fine. I found a lump a few months ago but didn't go to the doctor immediately because I have fibrocystic breast tissue and thought it was probably just a cyst. I casually mentioned the lump at an unrelated appointment on Wednesday, had an ultrasound, then a core biopsy, and got the call Friday. Now I'm here.

All I know so far is that the tumor grade 1 and well-differentiated. My info says it's infiltrating ductal carcinoma. It doesn't feel big to me, but obviously I know that doesn't mean anything. I'm getting an MRI on Monday to see if it's spread and then meeting with a surgeon on Tuesday to talk about a lumpectomy and genetic testing.

I am so, so sad. I just got married last year and started a kickass new job. I wanted to have a baby soon. I feel like I have so much love to give the world that the idea of leaving it sooner than planned breaks my heart. BUT I am determined to stay positive and fight like hell.

What advice do you have for me? What do you wish you knew/asked your doctors? Most importantly, I'd love to find someone to talk to more. Thanks &lt;3"
Jtrem714,1589605118,"I posted back in early January when my wife was first diagnosed. 

Initially, her CA 15-3 levels were very elevated Over 100. (Normal less than 30) 

She had node involvement 3 shown on scans and all palpable. 

After chemo 5 of 6 she is at 40 on the CA 15-3. All nodes are non-palpable now and tumor has diminished. 

She just finished 6 of 6 this week. (AC chemo, plus Taxotere) 

Due for an MRI and diagnostic mammogram next week before pre-op. 

Worried with the initial CA 15-3 being so high. The oncologist said not to worry as long as its going down (Which it has been) 

Very little information on the web in regards to these markers. While I know everyone's case is different has anyone else had issues with high levels of CA 15-3?"
mreeeena,1589597302,"Hello! I’m 29(F) and stopped breastfeeding 7 months ago. 

A few weeks ago, I noticed a small, sore lump (5 o’clock) on my right breast that seems to fluctuate in size and pain with my menstrual cycle. My PCP referred me for breast imaging just to be safe and I’m glad she did. 

Ultrasound — nothing remarkable. Referred for 3D mammogram. 

3D mammogram — lump seems benign, but I should keep an eye on it. The radiologist noted some calcification at another region near the lump. Referred for a magnified mammogram. 

Magnified mammogram — calcifications did not appear as “tea cup” shaped (or benign), and seemed suspicious. Referred for biopsy. 

I have yet to schedule the biopsy, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am for the comprehensive cascade of tests I received within the same appointment.

I’ve also been told that I have extremely dense breasts, and am a bit nervous about what that means for my future screening visits. 

Hoping it’s nothing 🙏🏻🙈

kirbieeee,1589582085,"Hi everyone! I was experiencing discharge from my left nipple only for a while (honestly like a year) before my boyfriend told me it was weird and should get it looked at. Me being me I blew him off (I’ll be dammed if a man tries to tell me about my body lmao I’m stubborn af). Anyways I casually brought it up over drinks with my roommate and she confirmed it was not good. When we googled it I saw it was indicative of possible breast cancer, freaked out, and made an appointment with my OB-GYN. The discharge isn’t a lot but it smells kinda funny and my nipple is also inverted on only the side with the discharge.
I saw the doctor and she did a breast exam. She found a lump on the same breast that had the inverted nipple + nipple discharge. She referred me to a breast specialist yesterday and I already have an appointment for an ultrasound and consult on Monday. 
I am honestly terrified. I feel like if it was just one thing and not a combo of the discharge, inversion, and lump I wouldn’t be so worried. I also am questioning if I was not self examining my breast right because I honestly can’t feel the lump that my doctor is talking about other than when she showed me in the appointment. I have no idea what to make of this. 
My 24th birthday was a week from today. I feel crazy for being this worried because I am young and healthy but I am. My maternal aunt passed away from breast cancer and all I can do is worry.

Giggling_again,1589562876,"Had mastectomy in Oct and implant in Jan.  Surgeon wanted swelling to go down before any asymmetry surgery.  At first breasts looked almost identical in size.  But implant ""fell"" slightly and healthy breast shrunk almost 1-cup from failed tamaxifen &amp; no HTR therapy.

I've had a lot of surgeries for other Ailments and don't want to get obsessive with this but
A) still wanna feel like me
B) afraid 4-more years of Trump might end my ability to get asymmetry surgery thru insurance and I cannot afford all the stuff my doctor wants to do by myself!

Questions:
1) Above-mentioned muscle Implant in mastectomy feels great to touch BUT no sensation - although still really early!  How does implant in healthy breast feel as far as movement, weight, and sexually/sensually?  Do you lose any feeling in nipple?  

2) does it still feel the same during sex?  I don't mean nipple play.  I mean like in some positions how you can feel tingling /pounding thruout breasts- does that get lessened or deadened?

3) what about w/ fat grafting?

4) reconstructed breast is only 3.5 months old is just un-numbing and I can feel (or think I do) some warmth/pulse of hubby BUT nipple is way off-center!  Surgeon says he can fix w/o causing more nerve damage by ""shifting"" nipple (still attached to bed?) without cutting it off and re-attaching.  Those of you w/ extensive reconstruction, is it worth risk if you think some sensation is coming back?  What are your experiences?

Thank you to all for this community!"
Giggling_again,1589561709,"Please bear w/ mistakes in lingo, I'm learning, so please answer in as much plain English (non-medical jargon) as possible 😕

Sorry for length, just really, really confused!  Corvid stopped chance of having cancer group meetings and asking other women their advice!

Age 44: No BRCR.  Non-invasive stage 0 DCIS ER/PR positive (90%/30%), grade 3 (aggressive) was super extensive where lumptectomy was not a choice, so mastectomy in Oct and implant in Jan 2020 w/ more reconstructive surgery planned.  Healthy Right breast was ""my option"" (lol - wtf) to remove at same time because of failed biopsy in suspicious area.  I decided on biopsy/lumptectomy (had 3 fibroadenomas at age 21) to determine what was going on (before mastectomy) because the idea of removing healthy breast was super stressful!  Idea of no feeling in chest when nipple play needed to help orgasm seemed... You know!  

Plus, I was told right breast wouldn't be affected by biopsy/lumptectomy since so small (previous history w/ large grape-sized fibroadenomas left scarring but no size changes)-  BUT total Bullshit, and area removed as ""biopsy"" was downplayed by surgeon who later described 1.5"" scar as ""tiny scar/cut!"". So breast is now mis-shapened and 1-month tamaxifen + 5+ month no extra HTR from hysterectomy caused healthy breast to shrink almost 1 cup size.

Prior medically history: Endometriosis, fibromyalgia, prolapse-causing hysterectomy; Ovaries were left.

Family history: mom's aunt (grandma's sister) had breast cancer (but she was about 400lbs) and her daughter (other medical problems).  Otherwise, 3 generations of women on each side AND no prior cancer!

Medication problems: can lick an aspirin and get the WORST SIDE EFFECTS, always!

6-month treatment w/ Lupron for Endometriosis (when 19) stopped after 2nd injection due to side effects.  Tamaxifen, only 5mg dose, stopped after 1 month due to massive side effects!

1st oncologist: I requested to see oncologist BEFORE mastectomy to understand return rate in healthy breast (to help decide pre-emptive mastectomy question) w/o tamaxifen when I read 1/3 of women stop tamaxifen early due to side effects AND I'M THE SIDE EFFECT QUEEN!  He said up to 15-20% return/reoccurrence if no tamaxifen in mastectomy breast &amp; AT FIRST, same in healthy breast (then he became more confusing w/ every question over next 2 visits).  Hubby calls him ""Dr. Ambien.

2nd opinion: surgeon said risks of healthy breast cancer were extremely low, disagreed w/ oncologist, and she could always do 2nd mastectomy if/when I wanted.

3rd opinion, 2nd oncologist POST MASTECTOMY: said standard risk of 8% re-occurrence in MASTECTOMY breast or thru out body BUT right healthy breast was the same 1-in-8 women stat as if no cancer happened!

Questions:
1) what are real return rates in both mastectomy breast/body and healthy breast if no tamaxifen for DIAGNOSIS at 44?

2) what are options to tamaxifen &amp; Lupron?  Do not want to remove Ovaries if it can be avoided!

3) if healthy right breast NOW needs more asymmetry surgery than previously thought, (fat grafting was discussed, now most likely implant), is mastectomy than reconstruction a better option or a fear-based option?

BirthControlMethods,1589508570," HOW DO THEY TEST A BIOPSY FOR CANCER? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DO A BIOPSY OF THE BREAST?

 What is a biopsy?

The term ""biopsy,"" of course, does not apply only to the breast. It is a surgical procedure in which a part (incisional biopsy) or all (excisional biopsy) of any tumor, growth, cyst, flesh, or organ anywhere in the body is removed so that its nature may be determined by microscopic examination. The results of this examination, called the pathology report, indicate the exact diagnosis and help select the proper method of treatment, which may be further surgery, X-ray treatment, drug administration or no treatment at all.

dmsblue,1589475553,"Hi, I have a question that I'd like to (try) to get unbiased views on regarding the statistical odds of things.

My wife had breast cancer. The breast cancer was diagnosed, surgically removed, and she is fully recovered and taking Femerra. The doctors told her she has a 3% chance of it recurring. My wife also has asthma. We're both in our mid-fifties.

We both want her to get regularly-scheduled mammograms, but are worried about potentially contracting COVID-19 by going to a crowded clinic. My own local doctor told me that they do not have masks to wear and if they do get them, they are paper or cloth ones; not ones that prevent viruses like N95 from entering into the body through nose or mouth. 

Is there any way to tell which is safest? Stay home without getting mammograms until there is herd immunity, until there are more treatment regiments worked out, or a vaccine - which could take a year or longer....or go get mammograms every six months and potentially get COVID-19."

What makes matters worse is that I'm located in another country - I can't travel back to stay by her side for the foreseeing future due to travel restrictions in this pandemic. So the only form of communication we have now is through video-calling. Luckily we are very close and we communicate very openly.

Our extended family is not close, so she is basically going to go through the diagnosis and surgery mostly by herself without much family support around her.

I want to do everything I can to support her, but now it all has to be done virtually.

emmanoir,1589316929,"24/f - So I’m honestly just really confused at this point. I went to an immediate care for a lump I found at the 3 o’clock position on my left breast. It’s almost like sore, but not painful. The doctor at the immediate care felt the lump, and sent me for an ultrasound at the breast health center. Seemed like it was serious based on her demeanor. I went for the ultrasound the next day (today). The tech felt the lump and even described it as “a large one, with a little one on top of it.” Took some pictures, and left for the radiologist. They both come back in, the radiologist does a physical exam and looks around with the u/s. Comments on how skinny I am, and says she sees NOTHING. Not one thing. Says the pain is something about weight loss, my chest wall, and muscles. Refuses to give me a mammogram (I asked). Signs me off as BI-RADS 1 or 2 and sends me on my way. Fast forward to two hours later - the original doctor who sent me for the u/s calls, and says she doesn’t agree with the results. That she knows what she felt and it makes no sense for there to just be nothing. She is referring me to a breast surgeon tomorrow morning for hopefully an MRI.

Resonance19,1589278631,"Hi everyone. I'm here because i don't know where else to go. I hope someone here can help me. 

I'm 24 yrs old, and for some reason i never grew a left breast. So, no i don't have breast cancer, but there is no other community where i can get help I think. All my research about breast onstruction and breast form products are aimed at people who've had mastectomies and crossdressers / mtf trans people. I have been using shitty chicken cutlets/push up pads which are completely inadequate for my whole developed life trying to match my right breast. I'm at the point now where the push up pads i can buy in stores can't match my real breast and I have to stuff with something anyway. I feel ridiculous that at 24 I am stuffing my bra with toilet paper trying to get some sort of realistic shape. Its uncomfortable and terrible and i feel stupid. I also cannot wear bathing suits anymore, as wearing a high coverage bathing suit and putting a push up pad in the pouch where you the thin pads that come with the suit go, isnt cutting it anymore. Its so painfully apparent that something is wonky there. 

Ideally, i would love to find a breast form that is really realistic in shape (appearance i dont care about as no one is going to see it) but i would LOVE to be able to go braless for once in my life or wear something open back... or bathing suits again. Most of what ive seen are photos and video demos of someone wearing an identical set of two and they tend to be quite perky and dont have any hang to them? My right natural breast is decently perky and B cup which im grateful for but, it's natural so it of course hangs a bit. I would want a breast form that can come *somewhat* close to a natural appearance under clothes when attached to the chest. Ive seen that there are breastforms that you can go braless with but im struggling to find examples of them under clothes with no bra and examples where someone is just wearing one. 

I'd also love some information about swimwear that's made for wear with a breast form if you have it! This is all completely new to me. 

Unfortunately i can't get any kind of insurance coverage as it's not a result of mastectomy... otherwise i guess i'd get some of this info from a doctor? 

Thanks for reading and for any advice you may be able to impart!"

My original sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative although I was told it looked ""inflamed"". I'm having my lumpectomy surgery this week as well as the lymph node biopsy with dye. In the past few weeks, I've been experiencing some aches and pains including random pangs of pain in my \*right\* armpit/upper breast area and lower back (but I have a history of lower back tightness/pain). I think it could just be health anxiety/hypochondria, but how can I know for sure my cancer hasn't already spread? I understand if my lymph node biopsy comes back negative we'll feel good about assuming it hasn't spread, but I also know cancer can spread through the blood. I've never had a PET scan, only CT scans of my chest with imaging. My medical oncologist said exposing me to unnecessary radiation isn't worth it for a scan that would more than likely show suspicious findings that are nothing and just get me worked up. (My results have all been pretty favorable so far... oncotype score is an 11, BRCA gene test came back all normal, ER PR + HER2- etc.) Should I insist on a PET scan after surgery and radiation?

So she was meant to go for her fifth year mammogram in March. However it was cancelled because of corona. Two days ago my mum came to me saying she found a lump in the same breast. It’s above her nipple and about the size of a penny. She has also experienced itching in the area. 

She’s ringing the breast cancer nurses tomorrow. But everyone is worried sick for her. I just don’t know what to do."

hushguppies,1589137763,"Hi this is my first time on this subreddit (F 17) Ive recently noticed that around 2-3 months ago both of my breasts started getting extremely itchy and started becoming red as my left breast developed somewhat of a bruise looking mark I’ve researched all of my symptoms and I’m afraid it could possibly be IBC and now because of this pandemic a possible diagnosis could be delayed, I read that this form of cancer spread very quickly so if anyone out there has had experience with this can you please give me your advice?

Symptoms:
-Extremely itchy (both breasts)
-Dry skin (both breasts)
-Redness (both breasts on the majority of skin area)
-Bruise on left breast (not from any injury) 
-Recently sometimes I feel a prick sensation
-Slightly bumpy texture sometimes
This “rash” also has spread to my hips (more on my right) and both of my sides (more on the right) right next to my chest

I have however, not had any severe pain, nipple discharge, orange peel like texture, retracting nipple or swelling/ sudden growth in either of my breasts 

I’ve been using Benadryl ointment as I originally thought it was just a casual rash and it did work for a little bit, it went down a lot in fact but now it just doesn’t seem to be doing the trick and its starting to spread on other parts of my body and hasnt gone away in almost 3 months if anyone out there has any experience with IBC please let me know if you think this could be a possibility for me, thank you"

I have an almost 2 year old that I breastfed for maybe a month (she contracted meningitis at a month old, and it was impossible for me to continue breastfeeding. Not sure if this is relevant, but adding for safe measure). 

I’m not sure how long the lump has been there, because I really only shave my armpits once in awhile, but I definitely noticed it tonight. 

It’s painful and somewhere between the size of a pea and a bean. It’s noticeable when I lift my arm. 

I don’t have a primary care doctor ATM, and I’m not sure what to do, but it’s really freaking me out. I know it’s probably nothing, but I don’t know much when it comes to my family history, so I’m not sure if my panic is justified or not.

jubeau16,1588973713,"Hello all. Looking for anyone who might offer guidance or a similar story, or maybe just some support. 

Been having random pain (unrelated to cycle) since November. Finally went to see a doctor this week. Been able to feel what my doctor called a “thickened area” for a while and have some skin darkening/very slight puckering as well (docs words not mine). 

Had a diagnostic mammo and US yesterday, only remarks were: micro calcifications and BI-RADS 3.

Right now, radiology wants me to follow up in 6 months (expected with BI-RADS 3) and that’s it. My doc said “things look ok, but if you want to see a breast surgeon and get genetic testing we can do that”. 

Has anyone else been in this kind of limbo situation? What did you do? I requested the referral for genetic testing and seeing a specialist (why not?) but I also don’t want to be unnecessarily overreacting or getting myself into a worry frenzy for what could be a totally normal situation. 

Can anyone offer advice?"

They told me that it's possibly a cyst, and since I'm young it probably isn't anything to worry about.

moonrox14,1588891177,"Hey everyone, I am reposting this because I didn’t like my wording so I apologize if you’ve already seen this!

I’m a 25F and about a year ago, I noticed a lump on my left breast at 7/8 o’clock, or on the lower/inner side, almost feels like it’s against my chest wall. Panicked and have had two ultrasounds but was denied mammograms due to my dense breast tissue. I never had a definite diagnosis and the second time, the ultrasound tech couldn’t even see anything on the ultrasound despite the lump being palpable. I’m terrible at measuring but I would say it’s certainly under 2cm in diameter, movable, and never sore to the touch but always sore around there especially around my period. Pain in my left breast has increased in the past couple months as well. Another possible irrelevant note is that I have permanently swollen lymph nodes in my neck but they were determined to be benign and probably due to a bad bout of mono and pneumonia. 

I guess I’m just wondering if the ultrasound can rule out BC without an ultrasound or if I should see someone again and request a mammogram or biopsy this time. I know Fibroadenomas are common in women of my age but the location and pain I feel around the area has begun to make me worry again. I appreciate any advice and you are all absolute warriors and I wish you all the health and happiness :)"

I (31F) am halfway through my neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  I’ve completed 3 cycles of EC treatment and had a check up with my consultant today.  They carried out a mammogram and ultrasound.  Before the chemo started my tumour was about 4.5cm, it’s now around 4cm.  So while it hasn’t gotten bigger it doesn’t seem to be responding well either.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Did you have to have more chemotherapy after surgery?  I’m still planning on having a further 3 cycles of pc starting next week.  I had been hoping to get a lumpectomy, but now I’m wondering if a mastectomy would be better if the tumour isn’t responding well to the chemo.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Next week: an EKG to ensure my heart’s in good shape and a quick procedure to put a port (catheter) in my chest — then we start treatment. 

The first of four rounds of chemo will kick off in less than two weeks.

I’ll do those four rounds of AC therapy, two weeks apart, then once weekly rounds for eight weeks. It’s an aggressive cancer, so it’s about being just as aggressive in fighting it. It sounds awful.

The first four rounds includes the drugs doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide, followed by 8 weeks of treatment with paclitaxel (Taxol). 

The first four rounds will be grueling and nasty. The backside of 8 treatments is easier, they say. We will see. I’m pretty tough, but I won’t lie; I’m scared shitless.

I’m going to be tired. I’m going to be sick and barf and my hair is going to fall out. I’m prepared for that, I think.

I know in the big scheme of things, none of that is important. We’ve bigger issues in front of us, like how in the world will we pay the monthly household bills, and for medication and treatments? Just how sick will I get? Will it work? What if it doesn’t?

Lots of deep breaths, and trying to maintain positivity. Thank you for walking alongside for this. I’m so thankful for you all. 

Also, So, the debate is about cutting my hair super short before it falls out on its own, and then shaving my head. 🪒 

I’m not sure I can deal with the trauma of a foot and a half of hair just coming out and holding it in my hand.

The mammogram was painful; luckily the two spots were benign cysts. However, the doctor looked at the mammogram and ultrasound and told me I have two other spots of concern.

She told me my options are to come back in 6 months to check the size and see if there's an issue, or to get a biopsy.

So here I am. 31, lumpy. I went to my OB who said I have large lumps and referred me to a breast cancer specialist. I met with him and found a 3cm lump and a .5cm lump - opposite boobs. he wasn’t too concerned other than my family history (mom mainly). 

Referred me for mammogram and another ultrasound. I went for that today and they found it to be dense breast tissue. In fact after the mammogram and ultrasound I found another lump which they didn’t see and they said that too was dense breast tissue. 

The radiologist said I’m not out of the clear. She said I’m high risk and need to continue to be proactive. The problem is I was proactive, found the lumps and they are saying they’re just dense tissue. 

I’m not a doctor obviously but I’ve seen so many things that say there’s missed breast cancer in ultrasounds and mammograms. In fact my mom was one of those because of her dense breast tissue and her cancer wasn’t caught until it spread to her lymph nodes. 

My question is do you think I should push for an MRI of my breast a? I have a nagging feeling I can’t close this chapter. I’m not always right about my feelings and I could tell they were getting irritated today with my asking to re-examine everything. I just feel like somethings up I have that terrible anxiety feeling. 

For those of you that have had an MRI which had detected cancer when the mammogram doesn’t - how old were you? Did you have a history? How hard was it to get the MRI order from your doctor?

NemoWiggy124,1588623350,"Hi community, 

Husband to a breast cancer fighter. Wife (30f) had double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders in January. 3.5 cm tumor, Er+, pr+, her2 neg, genetic testing negative, 2/13 positive lymph nodes staged a 2B. 

She completed chemo treatment with AC and starts Taxol next week. We had a hiccup due to Alloderm thinning with chemo as well thinning her skin and needed a second surgery to swap the expander due to bruising and didn’t want extrusion. Guess the expander was breaking through the chest capsule. So that was a set back but hopefully repaired. But our big question is radiation. We had a consult and they recommended radiation after chemo was completed. We may have done treatment a bit out of order with surgery then chemo and now suggesting radiation. 

Curious of everyone’s input. The breast surgeon did a lymph node sentinel dissection and margins were clear. CT scan clear, bone scan clear. Mentioned she wouldn’t need radiation even with the nodes due to the surgery and 11 other nodes negative. Plastic Surgeon suggested she might need radiation so we got a consult cause the oncologist recommended we do one as well. Radiologist said any one looking at the chart would recommend it with extensive lymph vascular invasion and her being 30. She did not have extranodal extension on the path report. Her oncotype score was 21. 

I’m trying to look at this by the numbers. And have checked some trials and studies but not a lot of info on younger woman. Hormone therapy alone brought her percentage of reoccurrence in the 18% range. Throw in chemo treatment that should lower to under 10%. Is foregoing radiation going to make that drastic of a change? 

Is a 2-5 % change worth extending the treatment/surgeries another 8 months? Plastic surgeon wouldn’t do implant swap till 6 months AFTER radiation with no complications. 

Just a long tired road and doesn’t seem there’s an end in site. Would love to hear anyone’s feedback. Please let me know. Thank you!"

I was just short of one more semester in completing my post graduation studies but my diagnosis (stage 3, 6cmx5cm size mass spread to lymph node, high grade and thus very aggressive cancer) immediately brought about a grinding pause to college as I had to start treatment immediately. I was to undergo 8 rounds of chemo. I started on 4 rounds of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), which was tiring but I bounced back alright after the first 4 days after every infusion (the lump reduced to 4cmx3cm size), then had a single mastectomy (the pathology report after surgery showed 2 lymph nodes positive out of 14 and clear margins for breast tissue). Now I have resumed chemo and am on my first round of Paclitaxel. It's painful, my muscles and bones ache but it's bearable for the greater good :) The notoriety of a poor prognosis of TNBC to begin with, and also being at stage 3, grade 3, I could give in to despair - but I won't.

Over the last 3 years I lived in UK and I did not get any checkups as the heath care did not support this. Lately, my breasts have started hurting in the areas where the tumors are sitting. I'm now briefly back in Germany before moving to the US where I fear the heath care system will again not support me. I'm now feeling like keeping my breasts is going to be a gamble. I've got a quite rational relationships to my boobs, I'm 32, I've had boobs for about 20 years and I've always found them too large (30F UK size or 70G German size) and I would rather be on the save side without boobs than keeping them and worrying about cancer. So, I'm quite firm on the idea to take out the tumors only. But there are stories of women (e.g. Angelina Jolie) who chose to take out the complete breast tissue and I wonder if that is a ""smart move""?

Has anyone here ever been in a similar situation or has any input? Or maybe can you tell me what sort of  cancer prevention support I can expect living in the US?"
soswam,1588402837,"I figured this was the best subreddit to ask this to. 
I am 19F, no known health problems, and on 90-Day Birth Control (Daysee). I have no family history of breast cancer. 

About a year ago I noticed a lump in the upper right part of my right breast. I was concerned at first, but knew that with no family history and my young age with no other symptoms it was highly unlikely that there was any true concern. I have no other lumps that feel abnormal on either breasts. 

Now, a year later I have noticed the same lump again, but it is larger. I wasn’t actively feeling for it when I noticed it. Maybe the size of a small plum?  Fairly hard and sore to the touch. 

I have no other symptoms other than occasionally I will get sores on that same right breast but that could be nothing? 

I am a college student out-of-state so finding healthcare can be a struggle, but I am absolutely willing to seek medical professionals if this is a true concern that should be addressed and looked at."

lunaboro,1588375959,"Hi everyone!

I got genetic tested last year. I have a 34% risk, so high risk and a chek 2 gene mutation  as well

My clinic in PA never charged me for my visits 

I joined city of hope in LA, went for genetic counseling advice since it’s a new clinic. I got a bill for $550!

It was $800, insurance only covered that small amount 

I was under the impression from doctors and prior visits to other clinics I am covered since I am high risk. My mom and grandmother both had it. 


Any advice on how to fight it? It makes no sense."
thepeachyprincess,1588369599,"Have been very anxious over the last two days. Maybe my anxiety is getting the best of me but I suppose you can never be too sure. I have the tiniest of bumps on my left armpit. Shaved maybe three or four days ago so not sure if it's related. Has been there about 2 days now. It's not hard, it's soft. I'm female, 21. Rarely drink, balanced diet, and have never smoked just for reference but I know that cancer doesn't discrimnate. How worried should I be? Regardless of the Corona situation (I'm UK based btw), I'd like to make a GP appointment, we are still encouraged to. But how many days should I wait until I try to get seen? If I even should at all. Do I just wait things out over the weekend and call the GP on Monday? 

Needless to say I'm pretty freaked out. I also have a slight tenderness, if I touch, not far from my nipple but I think this is from accidentally catching tweezers on my skin a couple of days ago as sometimes I have to tweeze a few hairs away from nipple as I have pale skin and very dark hair. 

I appreciate anyone who replies! I'm so anxious I could barely eat yesterday. I've never noticed the bump before. Can't have been there more than 3 days I'm almost certain."

Hello all of my breast cancer sistahs!

I am reaching out to all of you lovely women today because I am writing a book on the cancer industry and where it is lacking. 

There is well established gender bias in medicine. I want to know stories about when your pain was not taken seriously or when you weren’t believed. And you were right. 

For me: When I had my clip put in during a biopsy and I was in excruciating pain. The doctor completely dismissed it and didn’t check it out to see if something was wrong. He had placed the clip in my pec muscle! After my cancer treatment I was in chronic pain. I went to a post-cancer specialist and he told me my pain was in my head and gave me an app. Yes an app! Instead it took two reconstruction surgeries and 3 months in a hyperbaric chamber to lower my pain considerably. 

Please contact me if you are ok with sharing stories and would be willing to put in my book. You will absolutely be able to do so anonymously. You can contact me by email [maariana@ymail.com](mailto:maariana@ymail.com) I am writing this book because this is a HUGE problem that the medical community is failing to address."
catie2,1588279347,I just had my first biopsy on a rather large mass in my left breast. I was just wondering if anyone had any tips or tricks to make the soreness go away after the lidocaine has worn off. My mum had breast cancer but she refuses to talk to me about it so now I’m turning to y’all.
cactus-boii,1588276641,"I'm 17 and for over a month now on and off I'll notice soreness on the upper side of my left breast near my armpit. It only hurts if I press/rub it or move my arm. I'm a trans guy and at first thought it was caused by my binder, but I've been wearing it less to see if the soreness goes away and it hasn't. I haven't been keeping track of when I notice the pain but I'm hoping it's hormonal and related to my period because it feels exactly like my all over breast soreness that I get two weeks before, except it's just in that one area. No swelling, no lump, no other abnormal changes or breast cancer symptoms, just soreness that comes and goes. My mom had breast cancer. Should I be worried about this and get it checked out ASAP?"

She had me set up a breast ultrasound and the appointment is coming up but I’ve been really stressed out that it could be cancer. Idk if I’m just being over dramatic in being so worried. I’m just curious if anyone can tell me if my fears are justified or maybe I should chill until after the ultrasound? Idk also more info in 21F and there’s no history of breast cancer in my family that I know of.

That_Boysenberry,1588211827,"I met with my radiation team yesterday and am completely stuck on what to do. I am hoping for opinions/advice/links to further info/etc...

I had a 2cm tumor in my breast with evidence of cancer in one lymph node before chemo. I did 4 rounds of dose dense AC and 4 rounds of dose dense Taxol over the winter, then a lumpectomy, lymph node dissection, breast reduction, and port removal one month ago. The pathology showed a really good response to the chemo in the tumor in my breast, but there was still a tiny cancer in one of the 3 lymph nodes they removed. I am 95% ER and PR positive and HER2 negative. No known genetic markers showed up in my genetic testing and my mammoprint says I am at a low risk for recurrence. I am doing monthly Zoladex injections and the plan is to start Tamoxifen after radiation. 

At my radiation planning appointment yesterday I was told that usually they would do 5 weeks of radiation at 2 Gy per day, then one week of booster to the tumor bed, but due to Covid exposure risks they are also giving me the option of doing 3 weeks at 2.67 Gy with 1 week booster to the tumor bed. They called it hypofractionated and said that while there is promising research showing this is safe and even has reduced short term side effects, there just isn't yet enough research that they would offer this option if Covid wasn't a thing. 

My doctor asked me if I was more afraid of Covid or of radiation. I don't know how to even begin to decide what to do. Outside of being a cancer patient, I think I am generally low-ish risk of Covid complications, I am mid-30s, normal weight, active, no known COVID comorbidities. I feel like I am less afraid of short term radiation side effects, but terrified of long term side effects, in particular the risk of a secondary cancer down the line. I am also very concerned about a recurrence and because my cancer is on the left side and I am left handed (and already having some post-op cording issues)  I am concerned about long term limited use of my left arm.

My doctor sent me this study -  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459606](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28459606)  and said ""  You’ll notice that this study was done in women who had mastectomy, but we can extrapolate from it because we know already that the shorter radiation course is safe and well tolerated to normal breast tissue; here we are mainly concerned with the larger fraction size to the lymph node regions.  This study also used an even shorter course (11 fractions vs 15) so the dose per fraction is higher (3.33 Gy in this study, vs 2.67 Gy which I would plan).  For reference, the standard dose per fraction is 2 Gy. ""

What would you do?  What do you know about hypofractionated radiation? What other info is out there about hypofractionated radiation? Help!"
sunt_,1588205528,"I had a core needle breast biopsy performed a little over a year ago, and the results came back benign and the doctor said I had a large fibroadenoma. I was not asked if I wanted to schedule a surgery to have it removed or not at that time. However recently it has been causing me a lot more pain, it hurts if I roll onto my left breast in bed, or if I try to go running, and even hurts to touch. It also visually makes my left breast appear larger than my right (and you can physically see the lump under he skin). 

So I have two questions. First, does anyone know how to obtain your biopsy slides/whole slide images? I work in pathology so would love to get a second opinion especially seeing how often patients are misdiagnosed.  Second, do you think it is worth getting the surgery to have it removed considering the pain/physical appearance?

HeyDollFace,1588036059,"This post may be long, im sorry. I am trying to be strong and positive but I feel so uncertain about the future and I have so many questions. Any advice will help. Let me start from the beginning.

I am 24 years old and in graduate school. About a month ago, I felt a small lump in my right breast and went to get it checked out. 3 doctors saying it was nothing, 2 ultrasounds, and 1 biopsy later, i got the news. Triple negative high nuclear grade breast cancer.

I did genetic testing, and I have no gene mutations. I feel so grateful for this, as my risk of other forms of cancer are almost 0. Also, the lump is small, less than an inch, and the doctors say my prognosis is very good. There may be something in one single lymph node, they aren't sure, but they will do a biopsy and will be removing a few lymph nodes anyways so it doesn't seem that bad. My PET scan is in a couple days, but my doctor says there is no evidence that the cancer has gone anywhere else in my body. 

I am finishing finals right now while undergoing fertility treatment, and starting chemo on the 11th. I will undergo chemo for 6 months and then have a bilateral mastectomy, followed by reconstruction. I decided on the bilateral mastectomy because while I want to reduce my chances of having any reoccurrences in the future.

I am trying so hard to be strong for myself and my family, but I am so scared. Additionally, because of coronavirus, I have to go to all of my visits alone. This means that I have to collect all my information alone, compose myself, and then be able to relay it to my family who are all so worried about me. I talked to a few family friends for advice, and they told me such overwhelmingly negative things about chemo. I know its going to be a difficult journey, but I am feeling confident and healthy and I have no other complications, so I am going to try to continue going to school while I do chemo. I am lucky enough that the first half of my chemo is during the summer, so I can be with my family and focus on treatment, and hopefully by the time I go back to school I will be prepared enough to know what to expect and handle it. School is very important to me, and im not the type to put my life on hold for anything, and I truly believe that it will make me feel better to continue on with my normal activities (greatly reduced, of course) while I do treatment to maintain some sense of normalcy and control. 

After talking to my family friends who also had breast cancer, and they told me such scary things that now I dont know what to think and I am feeling so much less positive. I dont want to sound rude, but they are much older than me, and I really want to believe that since I'm young and healthy and strong I will be able to jump over any hurdles that come my way, but they keep telling me that its going to be impossible to do anything or continue any part of my normal life, and that my skin and nails are going to be completely ruined and that  I'm going to be uncomfortable all the time. Its making it really hard to remain positive, and I just need some more advice. 

Here is the chemotherapy regimen I am going to be taking. Please let me know if you have any advice on this. 

3 months of Taxol (1x a week) and Carboplatin (once every 3 weeks,), followed by 3 months of Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 3 weeks. The taxol and carbo I will be taking during the summer, and the AC I'm going to try and do while continuing school. All my teachers are aware of my situation, and have offered to help in any way possible. Its really important for me to continue going to school. Can you guys please tell me your feelings about these drugs and this plan? My family friends told me that the AC would be nearly impossible to function on, and that even though Im young I will still struggle to do anything else. They keep using the term chemo brain, can anyone explain this to me?

Also, all my hair is going to fall out and Ive already arranged for a wig. I was wondering if you guys had any adivce on nice, cute head wraps as well? Ive been looking online but would like advice.

I ordered some Brian Joseph lash and brow gel for myself, does anyone have any experience on this product? Any advice on other hair products, or anything I can put on my nails to stop them from deteriorating as much? I don't want to sound self obsessed, I know getting healthy is the most important thing. But I do like to look cute and feel good and in control, and any advice would be appreciated.

Again, any advice on how these drugs will make me feel, anything I can do or take to make the chemo experience better, advice on wigs, hair wraps, lash and brow gel, nails, and skin is much appreciated. Thank you to everyone who read this post. Just having a place to post all my feelings makes me feel less alone, and less like I need to maintain composure for everyone in my life. Reading through the posts on this sub, you are all incredible and strong and I want to feel that way too. Thank you again."
mvfulfillment,1587999529,"  

HI everyone,

I need your stories! I am currently writing a book on stage 1 breast cancer as I had a horrific experience that didn’t need to happen. These ranged from gender bias where my symptoms and pain were not believed, resulting in unnecessary suffering and damage, to doctors having very little knowledge in their fields, for example Hyperbaric oxygen specialists that not only unaware that it is the only approved treatment for radiation damage, but even after giving them studies to support this, they still didn’t believe me and refused treatment. 

On top of this, there is the industry’s constant over simplification of guidelines (mastectomy or radiation and lumpectomy for *every* stage 1 BC case) and the over treatment of patients. In 2018 a study came out that 70% of early BC patients did not need chemo. Then why were they giving chemo patients that didn’t need it! Why were they testing a treatment before it was administered! Women are never told how much each of these treatments will help them so they cannot weigh the benefits and costs to treatment. They are just told they have to do it. For example, some women will only receive a 7% reducing in the chance of their cancer coming back from radiation and this is according to the NCCN the governing body or cancer research. Shouldn’t these women get to decide if that benefit is worth permanent damage and the possibility of severe side effects?)Then to top it off, there is no accountability in the industry (please read “Unaccountable” by Dr. Makary) and completely driven by money (please read “The Price We Pay” also by Dr Makary. Dr. Makary is a surgeon and teacher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health)

So I want to hear from you. Were you ever told how much different treatments will help you? Were you ever in pain and a doctor said it was in your head or it wasn’t that bad? (Both of these were said to me.) Were you told about *all* of the side effects of treatments, before you started the treatment, such as a long-term safe effect of chemo is cardiovascular damage? Or that you would have permanent damage to your skin, muscles, ribs (and heart of it was done on your left side) from radiation? Post-cancer did you have issues and no doctor had the knowledge to help you? 

To all of my BC sisters I want to thank you for your time and we will get through this!!"
tellmehi,1587972166,"I have been having issues with my left breast for almost a year. It is painful and tender. It gets pretty itchy sometimes and I’ve occasionally had that lactating let down sensation in it and my breast just feels “off”. I went to my GYN in May 2019 and was given a 3D mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast and armpit (which is also painful and lumpy, I have axillary tissue). I had an unrelated chest X-ray in November of last year. All was normal. Mammogram came back fine just said I have dense tissue. I’m 36 so this doesn’t surprise me. 

I don’t have a rash but I’m increasingly anxious about the sensations in this breast that don’t seem to be abating.
I have back and shoulder pain issues on the same side and have tried to tell myself it’s possibly referred nerve pain. I am not one to shy away from going to the doctor but I am concerned that given my normal breast tests from last year there would be no follow up proposed if I did go. How is IBC diagnosed? Would the mammogram have shown it? I also have read it is fast growing and progresses quickly and so I keep trying to tell myself it’s been a year, so probably it’s unrelated. 

I know you guys aren’t docs, but I’m just curious if I should try to push for further follow up."

mghnmuffin,1587935621,"Hey all, the post got kind of long, so please bare with me.

I've had this problem for a while now and I'm looking for advice on what to do. Back in january I noticed I got some red spots on my breast sometimes, but they would go away after a couple of hours. Then I noticed the one breast was heavier and bigger than the other. This worried me ofcourse. I went straight to my doctor. He thought the red spots were weird (I took pics) but was also really degrading. He said it was nothing and that the couldn't see or feel that my breast was bigger. So I let it go. Then in february, I noticed this pulling feeling in my armpit, but no lump. Also, I noticed the nipple was flat and looked just a little bit different. It would still get hard, but otherwise it would lie flat against the breast. I went back and another doctor sent me to the hospital. I got an ultrasound done, but didn't get my results. After feeling uneasy I went back to the doctor and he told me I had cysts, but he could send me to the hospital, so off I went again. I explained my problems to one of the doctors there and she I could get a MRI done. Thing is, the coronavirus hit my city a week later and wasn't able to do it. 

Now I've been home for a while and I'm not sure, but it feels like my breast has gotten bigger and heavier. But I'm not completely sure. I called the hospital, but they said it wasn't an emergency so I would have to wait. 

Well, I'm home now and I'm still worried. I want to believe them, but I'm thinking could cysts really be the cause of the heaviness, swelling and (sometimes) pulling in my armpit? I very very rarely get red spots now..

I don't know exactly what I want to gain with this post. Maybe some advice on further steps I could take? I'm so sorry if this doesn't belong here."

There’s no lump in my armpit or breast but it’s sore, especially when I touch it and hurts when I lay on that side.

Just to give a little background info:

I’m 20F, never been pregnant/breastfeeding + don’t have any family history of cancer. I’m very flatchested too (i.e. could easily get away without a bra if I had to) so I don’t normally have any type of soreness from my breasts.

I’m guessing a lymph node but I don’t have any other symptoms and the swelling seems like it’s more on/near my breast than the armpit.

I told my mom and she told me to wait a few days to see if it goes away. If not, then I’ll try to see a doctor but amidst all the pandemic stuff, I’m not even sure how to go about this. If it’s minor, I don’t want to be making a big deal so I’m posting here for any insight. 

Thank you!"
gagonmyeleganzaa,1587865852,Hi all! I recently finished treatment for DCIS and have been able to get back to school. I am working on a project to see if there is enough/any correlation between salivary content/sexual behavior and breast cancer to establish grounds for further research. If you have the time and are willing it would be a big help to fill out an anonymous survey. Please and thank you!
Apr3ndiz,1587793626,"I am having mild pain in my left armpit. It has been there for almost two months. I think it may be a swollen lymph node. I don't feel any evident lumps or pain in my breast, and even when I touch my armpit I can't really find the source of my pain. I feel the discomfort when I have my arm down, in resting position. If I lift my arm then the pain is gone. I am 43 yo, no pregnancies ever. I scheduled a mammogram, but because of Covid 19 it was moved to July. I had in situ Cervical cancer 4 years ago. Please advise."
artemis_la,1587783860,"Hi all, 

I’m a female in my late 20s. My doctors and I have been monitoring a lump in my breast for the past two years (yikes maybe almost 3 years) every 6 months with ultrasounds. This lump has now grown enough in between my exams to cause alarm, and my doctor has ordered a surgical biopsy as opposed to a needle biopsy. I was in immediate shock when I got the call and didn’t think to ask follow up questions...so that’s why I’m here. I could probably look this information up but I just want to hear it from someone who has gone through this. Thank you!"
kyleneum13,1587778471,"I'm a 36(F) and about three weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night to tend to my toddler and noticed my underarm was aching horribly. I checked it out and found what I believe to be a swollen lymphnode. It could have very well been an ingrown hair or something but the bump under the skin felt like something more than that. Red, hot to the touch. No pain by end of the next day and three days later it was gone. 

However, since then, for about two weeks, I am noticing very mild aches and pains in both armpits and sometimes in my upper pectoral area. 

I have been meddling with my breasts every day since this started and have found no lumps and can see/feel no abnormalities. I have zero pain in my actual breasts, just under my arms/very very sides of my breasts and above them in the front. 

I have large breasts, have put on some weight, and have been working at home with poor ergonomics so it very well could just be strains from my large chest but I just feel like it's something else going on. 

I called my doc and I have an appointment on Tuesday. I don't know what to expect or what even to share (aside from the above). I'm over analyzing and over thinking. Unsure why I felt compelled to write this post, I guess just to get the feelings out there."

It is not physically obvious unless you try to feel it with your fingers. I don't know if I should be bothered by it but I searched that not all breast lumps are cancerous and some disappear naturally. I wanted to give it two weeks so I can observe any changes. So far, there's only the lump (right breast) and 3 red dots on the side of my left breast (it is itchy but I'm thinking it's because of the hot weather).

My wife is currently going through chemo and is halfway through tomorrow....with 4 treatments left remaining! 

We do have some concerns...she's been getting a growing bruise on her left breast. She got a double mastectomy and tissue ex panders placed in about 3 months ago and she's been getting her regular fills. Bruise started showing maybe about a month or so ago. The next part is to switch them with the implants after her last treatment but that isn't till June. I've attached some photos...has anyone come across a similar experience? Her plastic surgeon mentioned it was folds from the tissues ex panders rubbing against her skin from the inside causing the bruising. Was told to massage and keep an eye on with scar tissues etc. and that was the side of her lymph node dissection. 

Photos are of the progression any info would be greatly appreciated! Just saw him a week and a half ago and seems to be getting worse. Does anyone think she'll surgery? Can they even do that with her in active treatment? 

Please let me know when you get a chance. Thanks!

I have a 20 mm lump in my left breast, I paid to be diagnosed privately because my GP told me there would be a wait for NHS referral. I had an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy. I have another biopsy Tuesday to find out if some calcifications that were picked up on the mammogram are also cancerous. If so I'll be having a mastectomy on that breast, not just a lumpectomy. And then chemo.

StevieVonnMarie,1587507480,"Hi everyone, i'm 24 and I have had ongoing breast/chest pain for around seven months now. My Dr did several be tests to rule our heart problems and found nothing wrong. They even did a chest x-ray and ultrasound of the heart. I am in so much pain on a regular basis that I finally out right asked a Dr at a free clinic I go to if I can have a mammogram and she told me I'm too young for that service. 

I live in Southeastern PA. Please let me know how I can get checked out. I've researched online and I can't find anyone that takes women under 40 and its upsetting me.

Are there any clinics out here that can help me? 

I will pay out of pocket if I have to. These pains just suck. They have felt crushing, stabbing, heavy at times. If I lean to the left my breast just flares up even worse and leaning forward hurts and increases the heavy feeling. Sitting up aches. Ice has helped some if I stay perfectly still sitting up."
sugarmaple_sapling,1587494448,"To quote my surgeon:

“Well, it’s still a shit show, but it’s no worse of a shit show as it was last week.” He has the best bedside manner. 😂

The cancer is invasive and a mess due to its stage, grade and hormone receptor status (Stage II B, grade three, triple negative) but it has NOT spread to my chest wall and this is the best possible outcome that we could have hoped for, so we are mostly relieved. 

Now on to the treatment phase. First radiation, then chemo, maybe more surgery down the road, depending on how well I respond. Should start this in the next 2-3 weeks to give me time to rest and finish healing from the two surgeries.

My oncologist has recently prescribed me with tamoxifen and would also like to give me the lupron (?) shot to also suppress my ovaries. I’ve heard a lot of negatives about ovary suppression, with weak bones and heart as common side effects. There are, however, studies that show there is a better survival rates for women that take both instead of one, but I’m not sure how much better the percentage is.

I’ve never really been health anxious, but this pandemic has brought out the worst in me. It started with feeling short of breath, which seemed to peak around the beginning of April, without ever evolving into a fever, cough, or flu like symptoms. I’ve started feeling better, and am hoping it is anxiety, but did a televising with my doctor because chest pains and dizziness were concerning me, and got blood drawn to check things out (still waiting on results). However after speaking with the doctor I discovered a bump in my left armpit and a bump on my left breast. The bump on my armpit is at the very top of my armpit where my arm bends. It is probably the size of a small dime, and is on the top of the skin, slightly visible to the eye. I’ve gotten similar lumps before that seem to correspond with shaving, and figured it was likely this or an infection and would go away. The lump on my breast is right under the nipple at the edge of the aureola. The lump seems to stem from a small white spot the size of a pin. The skin around it is raised like a boil and red like the skin is stretched and you can see lots of veins. It is painful when touched and when pinching the skin around it it seems to be only skin deep, but I can tell for sure. Any other place on my body and I would say it was an infected pimple or a weird bug bite. There is another small bump closer to my nipple that feels the slightest bit raised....there is a corresponding bump on my right breast so I’m assuming that is a duct or something. I’m planning on discussing the with my doctor when I get my other test results, but between now and then I am freaking out and google is not my friend."
ASchwinghamer,1587246279,"Hi there! If you’re between 15-39 years of age and are receiving cancer treatment or it has been less than a year since treatment, we would appreciate if you took this anonymous survey! It should take about 7-15 minutes and will ask questions about your interactions with your cancer care team and some other general questions about your life. At the end there will be a personality test (separate from the research) that will tell you a little about your personality style and some coping skills that match it! We are particularly interested in the experiences and opinions of three broad groups of people. Those who identify as U.S. racial minorities (black, Hispanic, Latinx, Asian American, Native American/American Indian, biracial and multiracial), those identify within the LGBTQI community and people from rural communities. These people may have unique experiences in the health care system that are frequently missed in research and it is our hope that our research can be more representative of the many different individuals who have cancer.

Grandmameowmeow,1587149945,"I'm 27 years old, found out last summer I have CDH1 gene mutation that puts me at risk for gastric and breast cancer. Two aunts have had breast cancer, 52+ at diagnosis, both have CDH1 also. 

I'm in a clinical study at NIH for gastric and in Nov they found ""inactive"" signet ring cell carcinoma in my stomach biopsy. The Dr. there recommended I come in every 6 months for repeat biopsies. But I have ultimately decided to schedule a total gastrectomy during my next appointment. 

They did not see a need for me to get a mammogram or mri until I turn 30 and then they want them alternating every 6 months. However starting January-ish I had pretty bad nipple pain on my left side. I'm exclusively breastfeeding so I tried to ignore it and dealt with it. Then two nights ago I noticed a large amount of blood in my milk on that side. I went into the OB yesterday and she immediately said she wanted me to get an ultrasound to rule out breast cancer. She didn't know about gene even. So how I'm waiting to hear from a breast oncologist and hopefully get an ultrasound and fighting to get an MRI to be certain. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? I feel guilty for not going to the doctor for the nipple pain I thought was normal (I have two other kids I nursed over a year, but this one has just dealt with a lot of nursing issues) and now I feel like even if it's not cancer I will be planning a double mastectomy as soon as possible after my gastrectomy.

galettegirl,1587084238,"Hi everyone, new to this sub so forgive me if this question should be asked elsewhere.

I have had changes in the feel of my breast tissue (but no changes to the appearance) and have had itchiness, tenderness, even breast pain. I have previously had ovarian cancer and my grandma died of breast cancer. I am in my mid 20s but am still very cautious, so I scheduled an appointment for a mammogram and ultrasound right away.

The doctor very nonchalantly told me that I have two “tumors” that give the appearance of benign fibroadenoma. She was ready to leave the room after that so I asked some questions but could not tell if she had any concerns or if I should take further action...

So I asked for a biopsy - it’s scheduled for next week, which is great.

I’m trying to avoid googling too much. But I don’t know the doctor well, I did not feel reassured after my appointment, and  I have had cancer / have a family history of breast cancer.

I am concerned that the biopsy will reveal something else. Based on what I have learned online, fibroadenoma are not linked to cancers, but so many women on forums etc said that their doc said fibroadenoma and the biopsy came back saying cancer.

Editing to add, I’m frustrated - the doctor told me I am considered high risk for future breast cancer and that I need to start getting annual checks at 30, not 40. But I don’t know what to do about my current situation. my breasts hurt all throughout the day. I feel pain sleeping on my side. I don’t feel well knowing there are two lumps in there and I know nothing about them. It feels like something isn’t right and I don’t know what to do about it. I am sure others here can relate.

Even if my biopsy shows a benign fibroadenoma... how do I learn more about what precautions to take? How regularly do I get it checked? Do people ever remove them as a precaution?

I wanted to try to discuss this on this sub to get some input and try to determine how I should be advocating for myself. Any input or suggestions are welcome :)

Thanks everyone."

I would like to get it checked, but amidst this whole corona situation, I’m not sure how I feel stepping into a doctors office (given I live with immuno-compromised individuals). And I know this is a minuscule hesitation on my part, but my doctor is a male whom I’m not exactly comfortable with. I understand he is a professional, but for personal reasons I don’t feel at ease with him in particular for checking my breast. Are there other places I can check to do a breast exam?

wordisthebird002,1586942795,"**Symptoms:**

25y/o (yay, my birthday was 5 days ago.)

Endometriosis

Mother had cervical cancer, other types of cancer in family. (I am no contact and females are rare in the family, it's difficult to see if anyone had breast cancer.)

Lesbian (I'm just putting it because, NO, I'm not pregnant. There's a whole thing with docs not believing me.)

White ""pimple"" that has been just a bump for over a year located on right nipple. Was told it was nothing, last month it grew two sizes bigger, got bloody and ""popped."" The blood that came from it filled up two toilet paper squares. It is reforming and is growing again  since then. Discharge of thick pus.

white discharge localized on right nipple seemingly not related to pimple(???)

swelling (right breast swells to a DD, left remains a D.)

Warmth from right breasts

Extreme pain radiating from nipple/breast to armpit. (it has grown to include armpit now. A drop of cold water on my nipple makes me scream. Pressure hurts on my armpit and breast. I am now having to wear sports bras because going braless hurts too much but ""real"" bras hurt my nipple.)

Fibrous tissue felt in mid upper corner of mostly right breast but also left. The gland on top of my right breast is easily felt and painful.

The pain is now constant on and off ovulation/period. Worse on though but it's starting to just be bad 24/7. 

Periods in the last two months have been shorter than normal and cause stranger than normal reactions. Flow is different.

Finished a course of antibiotics(Moxi)/steriod shot a few weeks ago (I had an upper respiratory virus.) No difference in breast symptoms. 

Nipples inverted since birth but lately the left will stick out while the right is in and the inversion is more severe than what is normal for me on the right one. 

Eating gluten makes me sicker than normal lately. (I did the elimination diet about 9 months ago due to getting sick often.)

**Relieve:**

hot compress

HOT bath

crying because this sucks and that's basically the only two things that seem to relieve this now.

**Situation:**

PCP scheduled me for a mammogram/ultrasound yesterday. Did not put that I had a lump on the order. I was told to reschedule for at least 2 months out because ""Due to your age and the fact you don't have a lump, you are not essential enough to get a mammogram during covid-19."" PCP does not want to treat the symptoms or possibly treat mastitis without an ultrasound. (I'll get into this during rant/advice section.) I went to the ED in hopes of getting an ultrasound for some sort of diagnostic testing. I was told the ED doesn't diagnose cancer or mastitis and I should go to a PCP or Gyno. Gyno isn't scheduling anyone or taking new patients unless they're pregnate. ED doc is giving me a course of Omnicef in hopes it's mastitis and will relieve the pain.

**Rant/Asking for Advice:**

I'm getting a new PCP. She did not want to refer me elsewhere and did not want to help me on the order. She put galactorrhea as my only symptom on the order for the mammogram. I got my entire chart and learned she did an STD test explicitly without my consent and is treating my mental disorders inappropriately. She put that I'm high risks for HPV. I am a monogamous lesbian and we both got tested for STDs before starting our relationship 3 years ago. She also mismanaged my asthma. It's time to find a new doc. It's just impossible to find a new one and one I'll trust during COVID. I take a control substance for my ADHD and get treated like a drug seeker. She told me not to freak out but I showed signs of either breast cancer or mastitis. She did the breast exam and before said it more than likely mastitis and during said, ""Guess who just bought themselves a ticket to a mammogram."" She would not elaborate on what that meant and why. It absolutely sucks. 

I tried to advocate for a mri/ultrasound at the ED and he just flat out said no. He said he can refer me to outpatient but they will not do one. He did not seem to care that I told him I can't get seen right now and I'd have to wait 2-3 months at least for a diagnostic. He said he felt fibroses and *saw* that my gland in my arm pit was a little swollen but he would not do an mri/ultrasound. He did not do a full breast exam, he only touched the upper part of my breast near my collarbone and lightly touched the ""pimple."" He told me he could refer me and treat possible mastitis with antibiotics/ give me pain meds but that was it.

I went in for my initial appointment because of my periods being off and mentioned my breast being painful. I elaborated on my symptoms but the doc was the one that wanted me to get the mammogram and suggest possible breast cancer. It wasn't even in my head, I just figured my hormones were acting up due to the endo. She told me they could do gyno issues in clinic. I figured she'd refer me if she thought I needed to see one so I've only been going to my PCP about my issues. I'm fine with the diagnosis of mastitis but I need the freaking symptoms to stop! I can't have sex and shirts hurt now, I'm in constant pain. Plus if I do need a surgery, I need to schedule it at work. 

I'm also worried about it being cancer now that they said it could be and I'm afraid of having to wait 2-3 months for a diagnosis. I told her about it two months ago. I missed my first appointment (a month after me telling her) because I couldn't get to the clinic (healthcare worker pushed to the covid -19 area of her clinic...stressed about work too and it's hard to wake up.) I don't know what to do, if this is cancer, I need to start fmla and get sent to a less high-risk area of the hospital. If it is something I need surgery for, I need to start fmla. I'm also scared to let it wait 2-3 months.

MoistMaybe,1586838420,"I’m a 19 year old, with no prior history of breast lumps of any sort. I found one lump last week in my right breast, just behind my areola. It is very hard, not painful, but it does ache if I firmly pinch it. It is about 1.5 cm. I’m not sure if my family has a history, I’m a graduated foster child, and not in contact with my birth family. 

I of course researched (to the Google!) to try and get as much info I could. I know it is more rare in younger women, but not exactly impossible for them to develop breast cancer. I think it was very concerning that the lump is hard, not exactly the best. I also looked over my medicines that I’m on, for endometriosis treatments. I’m on a high estrogen dose pill, and studies have shown that while not always, but it can increase chances of developing breast cancer. 

I live in Seattle, and for a couple of weeks we were the hotspot for COVID-19. Hospitals are still struggling, especially in the city. I’m very scared to go to the hospital, as I live with elderly and immune compromised people. So I came here to preliminarily ask for advice, and maybe deduce some idea of what the lump is. Any help is welcome, peace of mind is all I want. Thank you

kelly2300,1586825957,"Hello Everyone, 

In June of 2019 I found I had HER2+ Stage 3 breast cancer-three tumors in the breast and cancer on at least one of the lymph nodes under my arm. I chose to only do immunotherapy (targeted) along with a complete diet overall, supplements, Reiki, acupuncture, Chinese Medicine,  &amp; spiritual and emotional healing. In December of 2019, I was found to be tumor free. I have done a few more immunotherapy treatments since then, but have stopped. I will have my scans again in late May. 

I've always known that my journey was never meant for me alone. I am in the process of chronicling my journey through the blog, Beyond Pink America: [www.beyondpinkamerica.com](https://www.beyondpinkamerica.com)  I write a lot about the power of food, listening to your own voice, God, and the body's innate ability to heal. While this is my story, it is my hope that it brings light to others too.

theworldatitsbest,1586814816,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer on April 1, 2020. I am 28 years old, and am otherwise healthy. My tumor is quite large (~5-6cm), and ultrasounds have shown no lymph node involvement at this point. The oncologists have said I'm likely stage 3 due to the size.

I'm starting chemo in two weeks (4 cycles of Taxol &amp; 4 cycles of A/C), and then will move on to surgery, and radiation. 

I've done a lot of reading on what to expect from chemo, but I'm honestly just looking for any anecdotal advice, stories, nutrition tips, words of encouragement, etc. 

Thanks :) 

Other info:
I'm waiting to hear back about my genetic testing. I'll be going on disability leave from work for the duration of my treatment to focus on my health. I'm in Canada - luckily in BC where COVID-19 is seemingly under control, so no delay to treatment yet."
lavloves,1586811086,"Back in 2015, my(21f) mother(43f) was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. They wanted to put her on hospice but her oncologist insisted on treatment. She made a recovery in 2017 and the cancer was gone. She’s been taking ( I’m not sure what they’re called, she called them her cancer pills ) for 3 years to prevent it from coming back. She also had a double mastectomy. We both have BRCA2. I’m pretty sure she was supposed to be going annually or something to see her oncologist once she was declared cancer free, right?  

Well about two months back she told me and showed me that her remaining breast tissue was dimpling like an orange again and that her nipple was crusting over. I begged her to make an appointment and she did. But she said “They” rescheduled it for a later date when that appointment came. Today was supposed to be her appointment and I was going to go with her. She said that she couldn’t go today because she was out of her pain medication and was having diarrhea. I love my mom to no end of course, but she’s a compulsive liar and often flaky, She always has been. 
 
I know she’s terrified. I am too, but she has my 7 year old sister and my 17 year old brother to care for still. I don’t know what to do. I’ve told her that I know she’s scared but I’m scared too for her and I want her to go sooner rather than later before it gets really bad. She’s ignoring my messages now. My aunt and me both have been begging her to go to these appointments since this whole thing started. 

What do I do?? I feel absolutely helpless. I feel like I’ve already done and said everything I possibly can, we’re going to end up losing her if she doesn’t step up. I hope I’m not coming off as selfish or heartless, I’m just stressing really hard over this."

PurpleLadybug_6,1586741561,"One of my best friends was diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer recently. She opted for a mastectomy and underwent surgery about a month ago. Everything went well and her prognosis is wonderful--no chemo or radiation, and her doctor expects a full recovery.

However, she's still spending most of her time in bed, and that worries me. She's never been a bundle of energy, but from what she tells me, she's barely moving from her bedroom. She's taking a lot of pain medication and sleeps a lot during the day. I don't know if she's depressed or too dependent on the pain meds or something else. 

I've tried talking to her, but she's never been very open. Right now, because of stay-at-home orders, it's just her and her husband. He's a wonderful man, but not very good about addressing problems. He's also working from home to try to keep their health insurance.

Any advice on what I can do or say to my friend? Or should I stay out of it, keep in touch with her and see if she reaches out to me?

&amp;#x200B;

[stage 3 breast cancer](https://preview.redd.it/bgdfj7r85hs41.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22392bfed8ef433011d2b4b0c81ef7b5ed934b25)

[Stage 3 breast cancer](https://www.breastcancerglobal.com/2020/04/what-is-meaning-of-stage-3-breast-cancer.html) means that the [breast cancer](https://www.breastcancerglobal.com/2020/04/what-is-meaning-of-stage-3-breast-cancer.html) has spread beyond the immediate area of the organs. While this phase is considered advanced, there are a growing number of effective treatment options.

This phase is divided into three groups: phase 3A, phase 3B and phase 3C. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes and surrounding tissues.

### Life expectancy for stage 3 breast cancer

[Stage 3 breast cancer](https://www.breastcancerglobal.com/2020/04/what-is-meaning-of-stage-3-breast-cancer.html) refers to breast cancer that has spread to several nearby lymph nodes. Doctors also describe breast cancer as stage 3 when a tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer has spread to lymph nodes, but not distant organs.

In stage 3, breast cancer can also spread to the chest wall or the skin of the breast.

Getting a stage 3 cancer diagnosis can be harrowing, but life expectancy and treatments are constantly improving.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9y1z6ixc5hs41.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d78eac81beb18ea7fc74a410d9f0851ef980b6

**What is the treatment possibility for stage 3 breast cancer?**

Another method that a doctor may prescribe in stage three of breast cancer is whether it is functional or not operable. This will determine more treatments. If the cancer is working, this means the doctor believes most or all of cancer can be removed from surgery.

Untreatable cancer is still treatable, but surgery is not the way to go because doctors feel they cannot remove enough cancer cells. Sometimes, treating cancer with radiotherapy or chemotherapy to shrink the tumor may make cancer operable later.

**Stage 3 breast cancer treatment options may include:**

* Surgery, known as a mastectomy, to remove cancerous tissues as well as to remove lymph nodes
* To target and/or kill or reduce target tumor on cancer cells or tumor
* Hormone therapy to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells, if it is hormones that drive their growth
* Chemotherapy, which includes taking medications to kill rapidly growing cancer cells
* Targeted therapy that uses your genes to attack cancer cells without damaging healthy cells

Your doctor may also recommend two or more combinations of treatments.

**What are the rates of survival for breast cancer in stage 3 according to the stage?**

&amp;#x200B;

Survival rates can be confusing and not reflect your individual image. The relative five-year survival rate for stage 3 carcinoma is 72%. This means that among 100 people with stage 3 breast cancer, 72 of them will survive for five years.

But this number does not take into account breasts cancer characteristics, such as grade or subtype. It also does not separate people from stage 3a, 3b, and 3c.

By comparison, the five-year relative survival rate for stage 0 and first-stage breast cancer is approximately 100%. For stage II breast cancer, it is 93 percent, and in stage 4, it is 22 percent.

**Survival rates for stage 3 breast cancer**

Studies linking the age of breast cancer survival rates to diagnosis have been mixed.

A 2015 Swedish study of 4,119 women with carcinoma found that survival rates for carcinoma are most affected by age when a lady is over 80 years old at diagnosis.

Women under the age of 40 at diagnosis also experienced an unfavorable prognosis.

Women over 80 years of age may have a higher mortality rate than younger women because their breast cancer further spread at the time of diagnosis. Also, women of this age cannot be considered as good candidates for surgery as young women."

deecanceresearch,1586724322,"I had a unique idea on a possible cause for breast cancer a few years back. I have spent the past two years taking science based classes and working in breast cancer research labs, among other labs, to see if there was any science backing the hypothesis. 

  
I have presented the idea to a cancer researcher (who has had over 14 years in breast cancer research), that felt it was worthy of further exploration. She suggested me taking a survey online to help measure any possible correlations. I had the help of an Epidemiologist to develop this survey.

I have just a few questions!

1. How do you know taller than wide by feeling? Mine feels diagonal, from my nipple going towards my armpit but at a downward angle. Palpable and close to surface with no pain.

2. I've had this lump for 2 years and was told 2 years ago after ultrasound it was just dense breast tissue. Wouldn't it be obvious cancer by now if it was cancer?

It slowly got worse because now I have hard dime sized bumps all down to the underside of the breast and the skin is discolored and rough feeling. It is painful just by very lightly touching and even when I am not touching it feels like my boob is being stabbed all over. Its a constant pain and it is very uncomfortable to deal with. This is very concerning and I'm not entirely sure if I should go to the doctor about this. Why I am worried about going to the doctor is because I don't want to risk catching this virus. I live with family who could potentially die from this virus. I just don't know if I should risk it and go. What do y'all think? Is this something that I need to immediately get looked at?

53/F diagnosed with Stage ll B grade three invasive ductal carcinoma, and triple negative. No lymph nodes involved, which seems to be the only good spot on which to focus.

Had a second surgery today for a re-excision of some chest wall cells as the initial tumor (a monster at 5.5cm x 4.5cm x 3.3cm excised 3/26/20) left questions about the margins.

All this during a pandemic. I had to endure both surgeries alone because the hospital is allowing no one in. I was the only person in OR today. Very weird.  Lonely and scary too. I work at a small junior college and I’m still working for maybe a month before being furloughed. That scares me too.

I live in a semi rural area but a decent regional medical center is in my small city.  I’m lost. Worried, of course. I’ve grown kids, so no worries about parenting. My wife is trying to be encouraging but is primary caregiver for her mother who has vascular dementia and end stage COPD. She is freaked out and I know it. I’m freaked out, I mean who’s kidding who?

I've had previous discomfort last year in August, the doctor said she wasn't concerned so I went about my life. January 2020 hits and I'm waking up to sharp pain on L breast another day it's the R breast. It continues on and off and finally in February I decide to schedule another appt with my women's wellness doctor. Again, she does a surface exam and nothing seems concerning but this time gives me an order for an ultra sound.  I get the 3D mammogram (figured to pay extra $ out of pocket to not miss anything, I dont know if the 2d would have been just fine too)) and bilateral ultrasound. I was certain that if anything showed up it would be on the left because the burning and ache was on the L.The ultrasound showed a small fibroadenoma on the right breast that was a little hidden, by the nipple. Biopsy was done early March. My result came back from the pathologist as needing more sample and recommended another biopsy. It seemed like the cells presented by the imaging center were not enough but based on the sample received the result was benign. The Dr. who conducted the biopsy felt confident that the 3 samples where from the nodule and was comfortable with the result as benign. I was presented with two options: do another biopsy or wait 3 months for a second ultrasound. Due to insurance costs (facility charges etc) I opted to wait. Now my biopsy area still hurts and seems like the color around it has remained dark, like a small bruise, about 1/2 inch. As time has progressed, the pains keep coming on both breast. I'm also experiencing most discomfort in the nipples that radiates around the areola. Mostly on the right breast and I feel lots of little balls/lumps inside, especially innerside by the sternum. I do have larger breast: DD 38, so I'm noticing stretch marks too and wondered if that can be a cause of discomfort.The pain is getting unbearable to sleep because the tiny lumps hurt when I sleep on my side. Nipples feel like they rubbed against rough fabric. No discharges or dumpling (that I've noticed). I can't sleep on my back because now that hurts too. Has anyone else experienced this? I emailed both primary and women's wellness doctors in regard to the pain but they give me no answers, and share that my demographic of 30yo healthy woman doesn't fit the breast cancer profile. What else can be causing the pain? My white blood cell count is within range. Hormonal level on blood is not accurate since I was placed on the lowest dose of birth control. Thyroid is fine. Any insight? How do I sleep with the pain? What could possibly reduce it? These COVID times aren't helpful either... Just builds up my anxiety wondering if Drs are missing anything...

1) My main question: if you live in or close to Ga where did you receive your care and how did you feel about it? I’m not doing shit outside of testing without a 2nd opinion. 
2) If you are near my age: what testing were you asked to undergo? I was scheduled by by dr for an appointment every day this week and Monday- (in chronological order) bone scan, CT scan with contrast, a mammogram, a biopsy, genetic counseling, and a breast MRI. I moved my ct scan to my last appointment bc it was was too much for me. Is this normal??? I don’t feel like it is. My mammographer was so upset about having to give me care bc I’m 20 days post op and per standard they don’t mammogram anyone until they are 6 months post op. I got sent home from my biopsy today bc they couldn’t find anything worth looking at. I feel like that happened bc of my recent surgery and the dr being asked to was looking at my post op ultrasounds going ‘how?.’ I basically had and ultrasound on my armpit and they told me to have a good day when I was scheduled for a needle biopsy. 
3) Would anyone similar to my care be willing to privately compare test results?

I’m basically overwhelmed and I’m completely questioning the care I’m receiving based off the reactions from the other care providers I’m dealing with.

I never even really looked at it until today. I woke up today and not only has the lump became harder, but my entire  rib(or bone?)under my breast is swollen. I'm not sure what that bone or muscle is called that's right there under the breast but I've assumed that it's a rib.. the entire thing is swole, I'm not talking about just a lump on the rib/bone, but the whole(or half) length of it.

If I lift my arm up, the lump on my breast starts right there at the edge of my armpit(but it's still on my breast) and that's where the swollen bone or rib starts(that's where the swelling starts under my breast). So I never looked at this lump until today and there is a very tiny red dot over it. It is not a pimple , this red dot is under my skin. You can't feel it at all but you can see it. The lump is hard and does not move. Could this be Inflammatory breast cancer? I am not able to book an appointment because the only place in my town that does mammograms/breasts is our hospital and they are not taking appointments for anything other than emergencies until May 15th due to the COVID 19 virus. 

If I stand in the mirror you can clearly see the bone/rib on my side under my breast is swole. This rib or bone starts swelling where the lump on my breast is and I can follow it with my hand a couple of inches going towards my back. I'm not sure if this makes any sense and I'm not sure if I can post photos , black out certain parts? I don't know. I know the red dot is not a pimple because I have just recently noticed more of these on my body(stomach and chest). I can't really tell how large the lump is, it is hard on top and is like it changes different shape, I'm not sure how to explain. But seeing how swole my rib is has me worried, as well as this red dot.  the area around my nipples seems as though it is getting saggy, and I have spots around my nipples that look like it could be mashed? I don't mash them but I have also noticed white discharge from my nipple several times. I have never breast feed , been pregnant, or have had children. 

Has anyone had an experience similar to this that the got checked out and diagnosed? I have not had any pain with this lump, but today it feels rather sore but I'm not sure if that is from me messing with it and trying to look at it or not. The lump does not hurt at all but the bone under it is what I'm saying feels a little sore. Can someone please give me their opinion on this , as I am not even able to go get this checked out due to the Coronaviris?
Thank you."
Lauren12269,1585177565,"Hey, this is my first post so let’s not be brutal. My name is Lauren 37 F, I have metastatic breast cancer. I just completed my 3rd round of chemo and I had my pet scan on Monday. I have to wait until Friday to find out the results and plan the next stage of treatment with my oncologist. I always wear my lucky underwear to get my pet scan results and so far it hasn’t proved me wrong. Upon diagnosis my breast cancer had moved onto several other locations but since chemo started every place has become smaller and/or less cancerous. I understand I may not get good news, but I’m truly hoping for some. I don’t have any questions but maybe people could send some good wishes my way. I know things are spooky and everyone has a lot to worry about. I appreciate the read and just knowing that I’m not alone helps very much. ☘️🩲"

purpboho,1584987528,"I’m a 27 yo female with no prior history of cancer in my family. For over a year now I’ve had tender/achy armpits, and for about 6 months now I’ve had itchy breasts as well. 

My armpits are not swollen and there’s no lumps, but I have a few small cysts on them that I am able to pop  (and they get irritated after I shave them). My breasts look the way they always have, but I’ve noticed there is a very faint shade of pink on them (kind of like a rash). The itch comes and goes but it’s always on the sides of my breasts and near my armpits. 

I’ve started to take turmeric supplements, and it’s helping a bit with my armpit pain. Also, I’ll occasionally put moisturizer on my breasts and it seems to help temporarily. With that being said, I keep on reading about IBC and it’s terrifying. 

I would just like some input on whether or not my symptoms are in fact a cause of concern and/or if anyone has dealt with the same and have some recommendations on what to do.

lenilchen1992,1584930989,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

In December I started feeling having a weird pain in my breast (left breast) but it went away after a couple weeks so I completely forgot about it. Two weeks ago the pain came back and it has gotten a little worse. Sometimes the pain radiates in my arm and shoulder blade. It even hurts when I inhale sometimes (like a sharp pain). I was getting so worried that I was looking for a lump almost all night last night but I could not feel anything that is indifferent to the other breast. The breast also looks very normal.

I have an appointment at planned parenthood tomorrow to get it examined ( my normal OB GYN does not have appointments for the next few weeks). Is it likely that I have breast cancer? What else could it be? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you"
CharmingWarlord,1584751906,"I wanted to share what has happened to me in the last 24 hours. I just wanted to make you aware that this can happen but it's super rare. I am okay and it was not life threatening, but very painful. 

First, I has my lumpectomy and 2 lymph nodes removed in my right breast on March 10. Surgery went smoothly and they determined that chemo killed all of the cancer. Yay! 

I actually got in to my surgeon on Monday for a post-op followup because I had some swelling in the lymph node area, not my breast. My doc said that it wasn't bad enough to worry about but wanted to get me in to see her earlier anyway due to the COVID-19 uncertainty. She said other than this swelling, everything looked really good. They really ramped up security and germ procedures in a week. 

So, I'm working from home on my laptop around 6:0pm last evening, talking to my husband and everything is fine. Ten minutes later, our exchange student needed some help in the kitchen so I went to help her. As I'm in the kitchen, my breast is totally engorging with fluid. It was crazy. I went from a C cup to an F cup! I was afraid my stitches were going to tear. 

My husband called the breast center but of course, it was after hours and the on call doctor was calling back. I was afraid it would burst so he took me to emergency. No visitors allowed so he had to come back for me later. The ER docs did an ultrasound on an iPhone, which was pretty cool. He determined that a blood vessel that was cauterized in surgery had broken open. This is very unusual 9 days out. He said my body would re-absorb it but would turn black and blue in the next week. He took a photo and sent them to my surgeon. He sent me home about 11pm and said my surgeon would call first thing in the morning. He said ibuprofen, Tylenol, and an ice pack - 20 minutes on 20 minutes off. 

My doctor rang me at 8am and said she would like me to come in for surgery to remove the clot and wash out all of the blood. I also got to have my port removed, which was a nice silver lining. This was a full surgery where I was put under and I'm very sore now, but it's no longer swollen like it was. I swear, surgery and medical stuff doesn't even phase me anymore, nor does having a complete stranger look at my boobs. 

Anyway, it was a crummy way to spend 24 hours! I'm glad it happened before the COVID-19 outbreak explodes here. I have radiation starting next month and I'm hoping to not expose myself to it!"
aliart10169,1584710032,"I had an ultrasound done last week after finding a lump under my right nipple. After the ultrasound, the doctor told me it is most likely a fibroadenoma, but I’d need to come back for a biopsy.

When I was 16, I had a lumpectomy on that same breast which was benign and did not need a biopsy after the ultrasound, so this is kind of worrying me. I am 24 now. 

My PCP sent me the actual results recently of the ultrasound that read:

Breast US
IMPRESSION: SOLID RIGHT RETROAREOLAR LESION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ULTRASOUND-GUIDED BIOPSY IS WARRANTED.

ACR BIRADS 4
BIRADS CATEGORY - 4: Suspicious Abnormality - Biopsy Should Be Considered

I don’t know how to feel about this, but I’ve been extremely anxious and losing sleep. I have the biopsy scheduled in 4 days.

What should I expect? 

Can you share you experience and bi-rads categories?

Thank you."
SpacemanSpliff---,1584599167,"My partner (30) and the mother of my 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. She started Chemotherapy last Friday. We are looking at 5 months of chemotherapy. Our hospital has been treating Covid 19 positive patients. We have been canceling tests and scans this week to be on absolute lockdown in our home. This was our decision.

I'm absolutely terrified of taking her back to the hospital for her next chemotherapy. The hospital (like most) are funneling everyone through 2 entrances for Covid 19. Does anyone have any suggestions for alternative ways of getting the drugs in her safely, while decreasing the risk of infection.

There's nothing like this in my left nipple, it's all soft like it should be. How common is it to have breast cancer at 20? 

Also, I recently produced milk in my breasts due to taking risperidone for mental health problems (it makes prolactin go high). It has been around 2 months since I stopped taking it.

I've had a bump under my breast a week ago which first hurt and grew.
I got fevers from it and headaches (frontal headache). These fevers were mild.

Then it slunk and a few days later it hurt above my breast and near my armpit. I got an awful fever at night around 1 am and lasted till 1:40 AM. Inside my left breast I felt a burning sensation, was very cold and my teeth were chattering and couldn't think straight anymore.
I have no clue what this could be.. it makes me very confused. 

I got an echo around the 23th only because the virus spreading in my country I'm not sure if that is going through.. and I think it has a risk for me if I go then. Because the hospitals are already infected by then.

May 2018 she was diagnosed with triple negative invasive ductile carcinoma. She went through chemo and surgery. May 2019 she is showing no signs of cancer and finishes her last phase of chemo.

August 2019 she suffers from a violent nocturnal seizure. Hoping it's stress induced or acute she chooses not to take medicine.

December 2019 suffers a milder seizure and is prescribed Keppra.
Over the next three months her mood and personality changes but no seizures. She goes through loads of test from staying in the hospital on a monitoring machine to volume scans of her Brain. All test come back normal except she has a below average volume scan mainly temporal lobe. All her neurologist cares about is whether she is going to take medicine or not. She never explains any test to us or provides any speculation on causation.

February2020  at the stay in the hospital for testing she was taken off her medicine and was under an enormous amount of stress. She doesn't have a seizure and decides to go off her medicine. The Dr wanted her to take brand name lemictal and was going to transition her but was denied by the hospital. Wife decides that she doesn't want to take the medicine anymore because she wants to be a mother. She discontinues Keppra.

March2020 she is feeling 100 back to normal and non of the awful side effects from keppra. She's loving life and we start monitoring her ovulation cycle.
Last night she suffers her third noctural seizure post cancer. That morning she had called me to help ease her through a severe panic attack

concept51,1583780455,"My grandmother was recently diagnosed with cancer. Going to chemo therapy and witnessing how many women a fraction of her age are fighting with breast cancer has impacted her more than her own condition. She has asked me to share this letter she wrote, so I'm putting it here :

&amp;#x200B;

Why Complain?

As I wait in the long line at the border patrol checkpoint I realize I didn’t bring the letter that tells the patrol that I have been exposed to radiation.  What a new world I am in. I am a cancer host or hostess as you wish. This was not the world I  would have chosen for my age. I should have just died quietly in my sleep and not disturbed anyone. I don’t like to bother people, least of all my children.

My thoughts go back to the last of the many tests I have had.  I was in radiology for markers to pinpoint the place on my lung where this uninvited guest  lodged itself. I was ushered into a small room, given a gown, told to put the opening in the front, or was it the back? I find I am rattled by the event, the anticipation of another procedure, and the downright palm sweating fear.  As I debate whether the gown goes on the front or the back,  I look around the little room.  There are three walls of cubbies with neatly folded gowns with women’s names on them.  

Dear Lord, are all these women here so much they have their own gowns?  Are they all breast cancer patients?  The thought is painful for me to even consider. The lovely young woman who  came to lead me to her machine   said yes, they do belong  for the most part,to  young women with breast cancer.   I am so ashamed to have lived this long and been this healthy and even for one minute complained about this adventure. 

One out of eight women are fighting breast cancer. They have been through machines that whirl, bang, and hummmm, reminding them that cancer is their constant companion. They are sent from doctor to doctor, each one taking them out of the comfort of their homes and families.  There is the constant warning that over 200,000 women joined them this year and they know that  more than 40,000 of those women will be expected to die. And how can they live a normal life wondering if  they will  be one of those women?

They lose their hair, they are sick, they are bone tired, they are frightened, they must be close to breaking from the weight they carry, and yet they trudge along, go about their days , and probably don’t whine as much as I would like to. 

These are the amazing super women of our time.  They have mounted their horses, grabbed their swords to do battle with the enemy and they are a mighty army of courageous souls.

reddidact,1583541957,"I had a bilateral mastectomy (sentinel node(s) &amp; tissue expanders) one week ago.  Yesterday was my first post-op appointment, and I had my bandages taken off for the first time, as well as 2 (out of 4) drains removed.  Seeing my new chest was...emotional, to say the least.  I’m badly bruised and I can see every ridge, bump, and corner of the tissue expanders and remaining drain tubes.

For those who had gone through this or know someone who has, I’d love to hear about your recovery.  I desperately need some light at the end of this tunnel.  

How long before the bruising goes away?  How long until you felt “yourself” again?  I love yoga and find it integral to keeping me level—will it really be months until I can down dog again?

A bit about my journey:  I was initially diagnosed with encapsulated papillary carcinoma with a side of DCIS when I was 31.  I had a lumpectomy at the time and was told the margins were clear.  Around November/December 2019, a small lump appeared and it tested (FNA) positive as cancer.  Bilateral mastectomy followed.  Pathology results are not available yet (hopefully next week)."
mrsDasStahlBierhaus,1583512809,"I was diagnosed last September (age 31) with triple negative breast cancer (Stage IIa) and a BRCA 1 mutation. I have a strange situation with my lymph nodes, and I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. 

During my initial tumor biopsy, the radiologist did an underarm lymph node ultrasound and told me that some of my lymph nodes looked “wonky”. After the cancer diagnosis, she then did an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of only the second-most suspicious node, given that the most suspicious node was too deep to biopsy in that context. When that biopsy came back negative, I had a second biopsy of the same node using a different type of punch, I believe to give a larger sample. She also noticed that the most suspicious lymph node no longer looked suspicious! Again, the biopsy was negative, and the radiologist was satisfied that she had gotten the best possible sample.

A few weeks later my lymph nodes did appear on my PET scan (although I think it was “faintly”), and my oncologist told me that he expected to find cancer despite the negative core biopsies.

I then had a lumpectomy (2.5cm) prior to chemotherapy to give me a few weeks to do a round of IVF. In the same surgery, I had a sentinel lymph node biopsy which removed one lymph node. To my oncologist’s surprise, the sentinel lymph node came back negative! He believes it was other metabolic activity that caused the lymph nodes to appear on the PET scan, but that doesn’t explain why my lymph nodes looked “wonky” and then didn’t.

I’m reaching the end of my chemotherapy (4 AC every other week, 12 Taxol weekly simultaneously with 10 Carboplatin - missed two due to low blood counts) and coming to the next step in treatment. I will have another PET scan prior to my double mastectomy. Right now, my medical oncologist doesn’t think I will need radiation to the lymph nodes. But I am concerned that my lymph nodes will again appear on my PET scan, and that perhaps the negative biopsies were false negatives.

So, has anyone had a similar experience with suspicious lymph nodes but negative biopsies? Any idea what can cause lymph nodes to look like they have cancer on an ultrasound and PET scan, but then multiple biopsies come back negative?"

ZalyaT,1583409284,"Thank you to whoever can read this. 31F, all female family members passed except one aunt who doesn’t talk to me. No clue on family medical besides polycythemia, hemochromatosis, clots, hemorrhages, aneurysms. At 25 yrs old, fibrocystic tissue was diagnosed in my right breast, not uncommon I’m told but extremely(!) painful. Denied mammogram, understandably so with my demographic. Fast forward to last Wednesday, years without pain. Suddenly a discoloration, I suggested bruised or collection of blood. Thursday, both girls are piping hot like I’m breastfeeding again after 13 years on the 20th, and entirely too painful to the touch. Friday night, a lump quite visibly appears and frightens my roommate. I look, feel, and it’s as if I’m touching an unmovable bone such as feeling your elbow. Saturday my small gal, this right breast, grows so much that she becomes visibly perkier to three other friends. (It’s the weekend, I’m scared and can’t call my but that’s what every says to do.) Saturday night, my boyfriend finds a second lump while asking him to graze my skin to see how bad the initial lump stuck out. He pressed hard and completely missed the bone-like lump. I don’t correct him out of fear but he’s close to it and the pain is real. (His dad just died of pancreatic cancer last July.) Sunday, right gal pal gets even perkier. My neighbor says something.. a neighbor!. Monday, something odd happens, odd to me. I make the appointment, my caring doctor wants me in same day or next. But the lump gets smaller, only the bone-like lump. (Now doc is gonna think I’m wasting her time, great.) Tuesday, arrive ASAP like asked, hours before my appointment. My doc is great!!!!. NP immediately finds the lump my boyfriend found, then another in a different region,.. what?! That’s new from yesterday! I was sure I checked! I was taught how to check years ago! Ok.., grateful. She informs my doc who thankfully and expectingly says since it’s new to me, I’m sending you upstairs, which would be her breast specialist referral doctor. Tho, at this time, nobody felt it unless I sat up. At that point it was like I implanted a pebble and everyone’s face lit up with curiosity. Why?! It’s Wednesday, mammogram done. At first it’s “nothing seems wrong but let’s do an ultrasound.” Expected, yes, but why didn’t anything show up? Gratefully NP shows me what to look for with her. But in my PTSD state of mind, they’re trying to calm me. I am visibly anxious, evidently, but in my mind I’m hyper aware of what they’re conveying, but they can’t get past my nervousness. I get it, I apologize, I inform them that biochemistry is a passion so let’s talk. This is where I get truly petrified. I know this is long but I am utterly alone here so thank you. NP won’t focus on the screen, thank you to her for the comfort but let’s focus. This is validated when the doctor herself says wait, I need to see this still, where is it? (Crap, my nervousness distracted them too much, bless them they tried so hard to comfort me even tho I didn’t need it.) Doc makes me reundress, cool, but says the following: “this is a mess!” “My word!” “Ohhhh.” “WOW... (silence) yikes.” And best of all for my nerves: “You have so many, {cysts} they *haaavvvve* to be benign.” Ok that just scares me with her infliction. I can barely tell them all of my lymph nodes in this region above and below reacted within 30 minutes of each other just weeks before, lymphatic cancer checks inconclusive. No infections. Yet my labs showed something was happening, they couldn’t figure it out. Recent phosphate deficiency due to malnutrition because I always feel like I should earn the right to eat food given to me. I’m two weeks healthy. Until this. 

TLDR; left breast- one cyst, slight fibrocystic tissue. Right breast, too many cysts to count, suspected rock hard “gland” with a “softer lump” above it, “clump of fibrocystic tissue within a much larger area of fibrocystic tissue” that’s existed for six or more years, doc says too many cysts to count therefore it must be benign, this breast also grew at least a cup size and needed new bra, became new shape with simple like areas near discoloration happening south side of breast.

I am new to the group and looking for someone who is similar to me...or on the the same treatments. 
I am 30 and was diagnosed a year ago with stage 4 invasive ductal carcinoma. It is estrogen positive and I have been through 3 different hormone treatments. Nothing seems to be working for longer than a few months.

Today, month(s) later, I just noticed a brighter pink patch (same location). It concerned me, so I started googling (bad move)... things started popping up like Paget’s disease and information on other types of breast cancer. My patch looked similar in appearance and location to photos I came across of people with breast cancer. I haven’t had any other symptoms (yet, at least)... no flaking, no nipple inversion, no pain, no itching... just this weird red dot that became a pink patch. Does this appear to be Paget’s?

More about my mom’s story:
Her breast cancer progressed very rapidly and she underwent a double mastectomy, chemo, and radiation. It was rough on her, my sister and I, and her family (other members have also had breast/other cancers). Even before having cancer she was a member of a support group that paddles on the Ohio River together called Derby City Dragons (DCD), after her diagnosis she maintained this support group, upped her favorite hot yoga sessions, and spent more time doing what she loved."

Salvadorcat,1582757296,"Hi All,

As the title says, I'm 26 years old and was just diagnosed with breast cancer. I do have the BRCA1 gene and my mother had breast cancer and later ovarian cancer, which eventually took her life. Obviously the only person I want to talk to about this is no longer here. I had my biopsy on Feb 18 and received my results on Friday Feb 21 through an online portal at 8:30 PM (seems very unprofessional to me). Thankfully I wasn't alone when I found out and my sister is an OBGYN and was able to go through the results with me. What's so scary is that I really didn't have any symptoms or signs. I felt some slight pain in my breast, and being BRCA positive I went to the doctor, never thinking it would actually be cancer. At 26 I really was not expecting this. I was planning on having the bilateral mastectomy and my ovaries removed after having children in my late 30s. Now I will never get to breastfeed, have to freeze my eggs, and may never give birth. It's not clear what stage my cancer is at yet, and it is ""high grade"" according to the biopsy report. I guess I'm just looking for support anywhere I can and would appreciate if anyone could give some advice for the road ahead or share their stories."

me-meof7,1582480363,My grandmother had breast cancer 3x in a 25yr span. First the left. She got a lumpectomy. 2nd was the right with another lumpectomy. 3rd time back in the left and was spread to her lungs and bones. My mother had cervical cancer in her 30s got a hysterectomy. In her early 50s stage 4 left breast cancer. Got lumpectomy about 18 months of chemo and I think 4 months of radiation. She had very large breasts so lumpectomy consisted of about 3/4 of it so this made her back hurt very bad being so off center. 2yrs later had double mastectomy with no reconstruction. I am 46 and always go for mammogram. Last 2yr had to have biopsies came out benign. This time two different doctors rather not be involved because close to the chest wall and hard to get to. Seen 3rd breast surgeon that comes to my small town 1 day a week. Her regular office just a little over 1hr away. She said not sure of she can get without the wire location and surgery right after. I said no I don't want a lumpectomy and then have to be forced to have radiation also. That if couldn't be done by a regular biopsy I want double mastectomy. She looked at me like I was crazy. I told her that my mother looks like she has been in a fire from under her ear and her chest from radiation. She just went on to say that she sure is just dcis so that would mean just need lumpectomy but I know that this ups the chance of another. Has anyone heard of a galactography where they put dye through the nipple to tell if you have cancer before operating.

NemoWiggy124,1581954854,"Hi again community,

Need some chemo advice for those that have made it through the battle. My wife (30F) will be starting up in 2-3 weeks around beginning of March. We got two opinions right now, but are getting a third just to be safe. It looks like the treatment will be AC + T then hormone therapy after. Is there difference in the treatment schedule, compared to 2 weeks or 3 weeks? 

Dense Dose
AC - 4 treatments every 2 weeks
T- 4 treatments every 2 weeks after AC is completed 
Tamoxifen - 10 years?
or
Letrizole - &amp; another drug combination?

Do these vary much? She was multifocal, 3.5 cm &amp; .6 cm ER+ PR+ Her2-, 2/13 lymph nodes positive, negative genetics, oncotype recurrence score of 21. Her bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction (expanders) was about a month ago, all clean margins. Physical recovery is going well, but she still has some trouble sleeping etc. We are going through fertility again as our first round we only got 2 embryo's because we eventually want to try for a family.

Also I'm mentally preparing for the worst for her treatment with the nausea, vomiting, hair loss, extreme fatigue. Does anyone have any advice on how to help/assist/prepare for what she'll need going through this difficult time? We've got the wigs covered, picking up scarves, any other remedies to help make it easier? Everyone has different experiences so I don't know what to expect?

She is also is a social worker in a nursing home (I know of course right) so I'll be extremely anxious once she begins back at work with fear of her getting sick or an illness from her work. Has anyone else dealt with this at employment during treatment as well? Hand sanitizing? Facial mask? Work from home? 

Any other mental advice? I'm a firm believer in the mental aspect is key cause you need to have a positive mind set but it's very very hard on both of us. Some days she is good, others its very down and I know it's bothering her, but doesn't like to talk to it much. I'm almost use to the occasional break down with tears, with her explaining that she just wants it to be over and done with and I know chemo will be another big hurdle. We've done some counseling but I know we'll need more. 

I mention to her that we are at halftime right now after getting through surgery and pathology so one more half of just chemo (which will suck and be extremely hard) but hopefully it'll be over and done with and that we'll get through it together.

Any other advice or feedback from others with similar experiences is all greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

A few months ago it came back into my head and i started obsessing about it again for some reason, as it was still there and i could feel it...so i went and got it checked out by another doctor, she ended up referring me for a mammogram. The specialist i went to did an ultrasound and told me it was a very common cyst and i actually had a few, in both breasts, but one slightly bigger one that you could feel in my right. She did not recommend a mammogram or further testing and told me to come back in 3-4months so she could monitor changes.

EmpoweredHealth,1581352610,"We produce Empowered Health, a podcast aimed at demystifying women's health, and we've been explore the controversy around mammography's effectiveness. In the [first of this two-part series](https://empoweredhealthshow.com/ep-41-mammograms-maybe-not-for-every-woman-with-dr-daniel-kopans-and-dr-jenn-conti/) we welcomed researchers, Dr. Mette Kalager and Dr. Anthony Miller, who helped us look at these issues on a population level. We came to the conclusion that the mammogram, statistically, is a poor test; it finds cancers that may never progress, finds false positives that turn out not to be cancer, misses dangerous tumors and doesn’t seem to increase mortality rates.

Nonetheless, the test has a reputation for saving many lives, which leaves many of us feeling conflicted—on an individual level.

While research is clear that mammography is statistically not a good test for breast cancer, many of us know people who have gone in for a mammogram and learned they had cancer, which was then treated and considered a win for modern medicine. So how do we reconcile these two truths? How many women need to have a mammogram for one to find she has early cancer? And when it comes to your health, how do you decide?

Dr. Daniel Kopans, a retired radiologist who currently teaches radiology at Harvard Medical School, feels strongly that women should have mammograms. Kopans shares that he thinks arguments claiming the mammogram is ineffective mislead women and potentially could result in lives lost, unnecessarily. For years, Kopans has been an avid supporter of the test, emphasizing the lower risk of dying from breast cancer for women who get tested--so we knew we needed to talk to him.

On of the points made in this episode of centers around the understanding of statistics and how scientists are charged with finding significance. This in some ways maybe one of the ills of modern medicine. When scientists lose their ability to be skeptical of their own data because they’re pressured into proving their hypothesis, we all lose out. In fact, today’s researchers are under a ton of pressure to find something significant that they can then publish in a peer-reviewed journal—both of which help them raise money for their future research—that many are claiming statistics are the new weapon in research. As anyone who has studied statistical analysis knows, if at first you don’t prove your hypothesis, swap out a few variables and you may be in luck. The new trend in statistical manipulation is the reporting relative risk and burying absolute risk. This gives you a more powerful outcome, but one that maybe irrelevant to the general population. We try to break all this down in this episode so you call can recognize when this is happening in reports you may hear or read. This misleading reporting is not specific to mammography by any stretch, it is pervasive and does a serious disservice to the individual trying to learn and navigate the health new landscape.

We break down the statistics on screening and point out how easy it is to be confused, which is why we spent time this week on the numbers. Understanding these terms not only arms you with the knowledge to make evidence-based decisions around mammography, it is also important in understanding what is being reported on a larger scale.

We finish this episode by asking ob-gyn Dr. Jenn Conti how she talks to her patients about whether they should have a mammogram or not. Figured this group may be interested, links to listen:

She prescribed an antibiotic,  ran bloodtests including a cbc, &amp; everything looked good. It's still swollen,  sore sometimes,  &amp; my boob hurts sometimes as well. I asked my Dr to schedule an ultrasound guided biopsy bc I'm so terrified of cancer. It's Tuesday.  Has anyone gone through this?? How did it turn out? Im 34, i have a 2 and 4 year old."
staceycfreire,1581272060,"Hi all. I am a 32 year old who was just diagnosed with DCIS intermediate. I am a nurse and have been doing plenty of research so far, however my mind cannot be eased from the idea that it may have come from somewhere else or has already spread. I have an appointment with an surgical oncologist on the 19th but am scared every day that goes by there is the risk it will have left and spread to outside of the duct. I am scared they misdiagnosed and is actually an invasive cancer with metastasis. Whatever treatment it takes, I am willing to go through to decrease my chances of reoccurring. I am so scared. And still in shock with periods of feeling positive and okay, to just crying out of nowhere. To top it off, I have recently been weaning myself off of Zoloft, which I have been on for years for anxiety so my anxiety is eating me up. I have only told my mother, sister, best friend, and boyfriend. Any advice , words of encouragement, etc etc,? I want people that I work with to know, but also don’t want to be treated any differently. How have you approached telling people you have cancer ? Thank you and lots of love to those who have and still are suffering with this life altering, terrible disease. ❤️❤️"
iamjentoo,1581251982,"Hi everyone,

After recently talking with my doctor, I've decided to start taking Tamoxifin as a preventative measure. While doing research while making my decision, I found it difficult to find people with experiences like mine, as I am a high risk premenopause woman who has never been diagnosed with breast cancer. To help other women that are in my situation, I've decided to start a blog to document the information available to me, the decisions I made with that information, and the journey I will have while on Taxoxifin. The blog can be found at [https://precancerbattle.wordpress.com/](https://precancerbattle.wordpress.com/). If there are any other people out there who are also in this situation, I would love to chat about your experiences."
criptok,1581166234,"Hi there, I have naturally uneven breast and I purchased an insert for my bra years ago that I was told is made for breast cancer patients who have had mastectomies.  I only bought one at the time as it was around $100-200 but I removed the tag because it was uncomfortable and no one at the store knew what it was when I went in to get the brand or any other info. 

It is a rounded triangle shape made of mesh and filled with silicone(?) beads/beans.  It’s perfect for swimming and it feels so natural and light, I always forget that it’s there. 

Does anyone have any idea what it’s called or know of anything similar?  Id really appreciate any help."

She said it was a cyst and gave me antibiotics to dissolve it for 7 days and if it prevails even after the antibiotics then she recommended surgical removal of the said cyst.

ccc1220,1580950066,"Hi everyone,

I am 39, no family history of breast cancer, have 2 kids, and am relatively healthy. I hadn’t gotten an annual exam by an OBGYN for 5 years until a few days ago. (My regular OBGYN retired and, well, time flies.) 

During my breast exam, this new doctor remarked that my breast tissue was “lumpy and bumpy,” and asked if any of my old doctors had mentioned that—which they had not. She hesitated and then told me I could get dressed, then popped her head back into the room and said she was going to refer me to get a mammogram and ultrasound, just to be sure, since the lumpiness has never been mentioned. 

She sent me to a place nearby, and said that there were multiple locations in my city, and they also take walk ins. But when I went to schedule, the earliest I could get was in 4 weeks. In retrospect, I realize I didn’t ask about other locations. (Plus there was a bit of a language barrier so there had already been some confusion.)

I expect everything will be fine. But I guess my questions are, on the off chance that it’s not, how fast does cancer spread? Would 4 weeks make a difference? Should I try to get an appointment ASAP? Or is a 4 week lag time normal? Are there other symptoms to look out for?

Thank you so much!

trashmaam,1580795682,"On mobile, in case there's any issue, sorry. 
Also, this will be sort of a long post as I don't really have anyone to talk to about it so rambling may insue. 

My(27f) Mother(60/f) told me 27 days ago, that she had Breast Cancer. Her surgery, lumpectomy, is tomorrow. She said after this she has Chemo five days a week, 15 minutes at a time, for 4-6 weeks. 

My mother is my hero, she is the strongest, hardest working, most thoughtful and rational person I know. She loves my father and her three kids and grandson, more than anything in the world, including herself. She's gotten a bit more outspoken in the last few years (finally!), but for most of what I can remember she's been sort of a servant to whatever everyone else needed, without much thanks or gratitude, and never 'bothered' anyone with her problems. 

Today is the first time she's ever told me 'I'm not fine, I'm not okay. 

I called her because I knew her surgery was tomorrow and wanted to start the day off letting her know someone was thinking about her, just in case no one else had. I asked how she was doing, she said 'oh, I'm fine.' I responded with 'Well, Momma, you aren't fine, and you don't have to be. If you're feeling well, fantastic, I'm glad to hear it. But you can be honest with me.' Almost interrupting me but still in a calm tone, she says 'you know what, im not fine, I'm not okay and this is the first time I've really ever felt like this.' 

So I listened to her, and we talked some more and she sounded much better when we got off the phone, but I don't know. 

And that's the hard part for me. -I DONT KNOW- 
I have no idea how she's feeling, what her concerns are or nerves may be about. 
I can't even begin to try to rationalize or speculate, beyond being completely unfair to her, it's just not possible. I've never had to deal with anything close to what she's going through. 

What I KNOW I can do is be an ear to listen, or a shoulder to lean on, after the 6th I can run out to her and wait on her hand and foot. 

But I want to text her tonight, so she'll wake up to it. I want her to see something positive, what she wants to hear or needs to hear. 
Before the pain and discomfort from the metals in her body from the MRI medication forces the day to begin prematurely. 
Before showering again with the special soap that forces her to stand there awkwardly freezing for five minutes before shes able to rinse. 
Before my dad makes sure one last time she hasn't forgotten anything whilst trying to change her mood through jokes or some other irrelevant/inappropriate means. 
Before shes arrived at her doctors office. 
Before anxiously, painfully waiting on bated breath to hear it's time. 
Before the surgery. 
Before her entire life changes in a day. 


Is there anything in particular that you wanted or needed to hear? For the first time ever, I'm at a loss for words. Leading up to this; poetry. Now, I feel like a fraud anytime I think of something, because as nice as it all comes out, I have no idea what I'm talking about and I can't tell her what to expect/think/feel. 

I'm helpless, because she's never been. I want to step up for her, be there for her like she's always been for me, but I am not qualified. 





Also; I know my dad means well, and it may work for her, the attempts to distract from the elephant in the room. But having a similar personality, I sometimes feel like 'dude, I get it and I love you for what you're trying to do, but I'm bummed and I can't help it if I'm bumming you out too. Let me feel how I'm feeling."
NemoWiggy124,1580744812,"Hello again,

My wife (30 F) had a successful bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction 3 weeks ago. She is recovering well physically but it's very heavy on the mental side. 

Early Biopsy results were ER+, PR+, Her-. Negative for BCRA1 &amp; 2, but one positive enlarged lymph node.

The pathology report was:

The tumor was bigger than expected at 3.5 cm in her left breast. The tissue on the right thankfully was benign. There was another small mass found next to the larger tumor on the left which was 0.6 cm, making it multi-focal. The grade was bumped to a grade 3. 13 lymph nodes were removed and 2 came back positive, so 2/13 ratio. We also got her Oncotype DX Recurrence Score came back as 21. 

So it's considered stage 2B with T2 N1 M0 with a Recurrence Score of 21.

Does anyone know what her treatment will be? We know hormone therapy is a given, but chemo? A score of 21 falls into the intermediate risk of recurrence, which makes treatment decisions more difficult. My wife is really dreading chemo and even broke down hearing a score of 21. 

Does anyone have any research or what their 2 cents is? We meet with the oncologist this Weds, for what he thinks for treatment. I reviewed some studies of the TailorX, but it's mostly for post menopause and node negative patients, but really don't know what will get decided. 

Any feedback or information will be greatly appreciated it!"

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to ask but I'm looking for advice on how I can support my Mom and make her feel beautiful.

We are going to a friend's wedding and she is depressed because she has again lost all of her hair. She doesn't have access to wigs where she lives so I'm wondering how I can cheer her up and make her feel beautiful. She never complains about anything and I just want to make her happy.

Just 10 days later I’m looking back and super confused why I acted as I did.  But it is done.  Did anyone else seem to have life fall apart in other ways seemingly unrelated to breast cancer DURING the diagnosis/surgery period?

airahs06,1580484679,"Hi Readers, 

Last year, my best friend Kelly lost her mother to a long battle with ovarian cancer. Shortly after her passing, Kelly discovered she had the BRCA gene where they discovered a cancerous tumor in her breast. Fortunately they discovered it early on, however it resulted in a double mastectomy. She suffered many hiccups after her reconstructive surgery that ended up with her having to remove both implants. This has been a very long process for her and her husband and she has not be able to get back to work or even get back to her daily life due to the number of surgeries she has had to encounter. It has gotten to the point that she will never be able to conceive children either. 

I write to you all because I am putting together a gift for her of letters to open when she's feeling sad, mad, defeated, etc. and I wanted to see if the survivors in this group, would contribute a letter with motivational quotes, their stories, their struggles and how they overcame it so she knows, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My heart breaks, because I know I could never understand the emotions she feels and I wish I could offer so much more for her because she means the absolute world to me. Please let me know if you would be interested in helping with this. The letters do not have to be long or extravagant but I want her to know that she's not alone in this journey. 

Thank you for your consideration.

sahyadri1248,1580213471,"In 2018, a total of 5.87 lakh women in India were diagnosed with Cancer. Out of this 28% of women were breast cancer patients, 17% were cervical cancer patients and 6% were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This consolidated number only suggests that breast and Gynaecological tumours account to 50% of the cancers detected in India in the last one year alone. 

Luckily both, breast and ovarian cancers are easily preventable. If caught on early they have a cure rate that is well over 90%. Though these numbers seem encouraging but the survival rate related to these cancers is low as compared to other parts of the world. In this feature, we will touch base on breast and ovarian cancer and shed some light on its diagnostic process. 

**Breast cancer screening-** 

Self-Examination should be done on regular intervals once a woman turns 20. It involves looking and feeling both breasts for lumps and disfigurations once a month. Any changes if noticed should be reported to her a medical specialist at the earliest. 

Clinical Breast Examination is a physical breast examination done by a qualified medical professional. It should start in the early 20’s and is to be repeated once a year. 

Sonomammography is prescribed when the doctors notice a lump in the breast in patients below 40 years. A Sonomammography is a breast ultrasound and is a non-invasive procedure that enables to doctor to examine the breast tissue and the blood vessels around it.

Mammograms are meant for women who are above the age of 40. It is simply an X-ray of the Breasts. A Mammogram can pick up cancerous breast lumps which are so small that they otherwise cannot be felt on physical examination. Every woman should get a baseline Mammogram done between the ages of 45 to 50 and it is to be repeated the test once a year. 

**Screening cervical cancer-**

The Pap test is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix. A PAP smear is performed by a gynaecologist and is only a 10-minute procedure. A PAP smear needs to be done once a woman becomes sexually active and right up to the age of 65. It needs to be repeated once every 3 years. 

**Cervical vaccine and cancer prevention:**

The cervical vaccine is an HPV vaccine directed against the 2 main strains of the human papillomavirus responsible for 80% of all cervical cancers. The vaccine is given in 3 doses 2 months apart and offers lifelong protection. It is most effective in young girls between 13 and 16 before they become sexually active. However, it can be useful if given right up to the age of 35.

Cancer is a lifestyle disease. A healthy lifestyle and controlled Diet is key to keeping cancer away. If one still gets diagnosed with cancer, then it should be caught in its early stages, leading to its cure. 

Dying from cancer is not an option anymore. Spread awareness and engaging in conversation about the Big C is the only way we can win this battle against cancer.

It’s too jargon-filled for me to make sense of it, but now my brain is going worst-case scenario on me while I wait to hear back from my oncologist. The part that’s getting me most is this: “there are underlying discrete residual hypermetabolic nodes consistent with active metastasis...” Hopefully I get a call back today.

For background, I had a lumpectomy three weeks ago, had one lymph node test positive and the PET scan was primarily to establish a baseline."

frabbit90,1580042480,"Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this - I will delete right away if so.

I'm a 29 year old male and about 6 months to a year ago I came across a lump in the breast tissue on the left of my chest. Kind of round the side of my chest towards my armpit but definitely not up in the arm pit.

I'm probably considered overweight medically but not massively, and I don't have huge amounts of breast tissue (looks in proportion to the rest of me for a guy I'd say). 

Anyway, I did a bit of googling at the time, and decided breast cancer in men was so rare that it was probably nothing (stupid tactic I know) but not a year later the lump is still there. It doesn't seem to have gotten any worse but definitely no better.

I've kind of been on Google non stop for the past 24 hours and am pretty concerned thinking that maybe the lump is actually a lymph node that is swollen and has been for a year which I can only assume would be bad bad news! 

I'm going to get a doctors appointment tomorrow when my local GP office opens but in the meantime I'm just hoping someone could answer some questions that I have around this that I can't seem to find answers to! 

— When I see mention of male breast cancer the first thing mentioned is always a hard lump behind the nipple but I don't have this at all nor any discharge or irregularities in skin (dimpling etc). As above, the lump is more to the side, away from the nipple. Could this still be breast cancer? 

— And related to the above regarding lymph nodes, could I have just one swollen lymph node for this length of time without noticing any other physical symptoms? Physically I feel as well as I ever have!

- I see a lot of talk about gynecomastia but again when looking online this seems to be relegated to talk about the nipple only and not the area I'm concerned about. Could this be what I've got going on here?


Again, apologies if my issue here is trivial in comparison to what I'm sure many on here are going/have gone through (given the name of the subreddit and all...). Im just concerned and don't really have anywhere else to go to.

Thanks in advance."

After initial chemo, tumor was 60mm grade 2 (IDC) with 0/16 lymph nodes positive.

Chose to have double mastectomy and lymph node clearance.

Received further chemo (Herceptin and Taxane) plus radiation therapy.

Had some initial discomfort with axillary cording but not too bad.

Over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed some swelling in my right armpit. It doesn’t feel like a lump as such but more like a thickening of the area. It’s not sore or tender, no pain at all actually.

Hello everyone!

Later on this year **I will walk the camino del Norte**, one of the famous pilgrim routes to Santiago de Compostela. I'm starting from San Sebastian and will follow the northern coast of Spain. **A journey of about 800 km and 40 days.** **I'm doing this in benefit of Think-Pink**, the European breast cancer organisation. This charity is important to me, for the following reason. About three years ago, I've met someone who truly opened my heart. With her, I've experienced love in a way I never thought was even possible. Unfortunately, we are no longer in touch which is still something I regret every day. I realize, however, that if cancer had beaten her, I would never have known her. And despite of all the pain of the not-so-happy-ending, meeting her was the best thing that ever happened to me. So I decided to change this painful loss into something positive. **I've learned to love myself and to live my** ***own*** **life. I refuse to let my life be clouded by fear or be lived by the opinion of others.** Hence, this Camino will not be a project of sadness and regret, but of **love and gratitude**.

So basically, **I'm raising money for this charity**. And as I was thinking about new ideas to boost my fundraising campaign, I thought about **how awesome it would be to collect €1 for every kilometer I'm about to walk**. So here I am, turning to all the good souls out there on the internet. If you've ever seen breast cancer from up close, or you can relate to my personal story, or you simply want to do a good deed today, please feel most welcome to support my project. **I am so grateful for every donation.**

**Of course you get something in return.** **For every donation, you are allowed to propose a compensation from my part.** This can be truly anything: from answering a question (no lying!) to mastering a challenging yoga pose (which, of course, I will have to prove with photos or videos). The only restriction is that it does not cost me any money. Among the proposals, I will pick a few myself which I will fulfill with the greatest devotion. I want to make this something fun for all of us!

If you have any questions about me, my personal story or the project, please feel free to ask around!

**So here goes my €1 challenge for Think-Pink!** **Donating is possible on** [this website](https://www.okpal.com/on-the-road-to-compostela/?utm_campaign=01DYJMFECK8XW9E3ASSW7RRJSK&amp;utm_medium=campaign_edit-okpuid_01DYHQAJCV4J6ASXYJYXS1Q3HE-20200116&amp;utm_source=share_directlink)**.**

I failed to get it check for follow up ultrasound last year since I got busy and I just had the free time for it. Now I'm nervous as hell and getting paranoid huhu. 

So randomly at times I would feel it--I can't feel any hard lumps, like nothing's even there! It's just everytime I press a bit hard on a certain part I can feel the pain.

I'm no stranger to cancer and the impact it has on someone and how it affects those around them. My dad is 3 years out of Tongue Cancer (Never smoked or did any heavy drinking) with extensive 14-hour surgery and reconstruction. 

We have a PET/CT planned tomorrow morning to get a better idea of the involvement. But they suspect lymph node involvement. 

They plan on doing 4 rounds of chemo before doing surgery to shrink things down. Doing one treatment every 3 weeks (5 hour sessions) 

Things seem to be all in motion and she has a fantastic support team. 

Just have a major case of Scanxiety right now. On the ultrasound it showed the axillary lymph node to be quite large (Larger than the Tumor!) The radiologist didn't seem to have an answer for why when I asked him about it. 

Guess my biggest corncern is if the node is that large its spread to a lot more or even worse somwhere else! Doing the worst thing right now and trying to google things before the PET/CT tomorrow to ease my mind. Anyone else have something silmilar happen? I know sometimes ultrasounds can miss things. 

Shes in good spirits and Ive been keeping my game face on and we are hitting this head on! 

I truly am sorry for everyone that is going through this, or cares for someone going through this or even knows anyone going through this."
Husbandcaregiver,1579129835,"Hi All, this is my first post here. My wife was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at age 34 just 6 months ago. It spread to her sternum. Right now she has terrible thrush in her mouth due to using steroids/prednisone for so long now. She is doing an immunotherapy clinical trial and in order to keep her liver enzymes under control she is not able to take medication that can usually easily cure thrush like diflucan. She has been using a prescription rinse, clotrimazone lozenges, salt and baking soda rinses, but no luck. It just keeps getting worse, so bad she’s not able to really enjoy eating anything. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

whtamidoinlol,1579000112,"Posting on behalf of my lovely mum!

I had a routine mammogram in October and they discovered a lump. I then had a biopsy and it tested positive for Stage 2 Breast Cancer. I have had 2 surgeries to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue and leave clear margins. I also tested positive in 3 nodes.

Basically, I'm pretty much borderline between stages 2/3, my lump was 20 mm (lumps up to 20 are radiotherapy, above that chemo) and 3 nodes or more is chemo and less than 3 is radiotherapy. Not a clear decision either way! 

My doctor says I therefore have a choice between radiotherapy and chemotherapy, OR taking part in something called the 'Optima Trial'. Which, in simple terms, means we're split into two groups and don't know which we are in. Group 1 - gets chemotherapy. Group 2 - they test a portion of cancerous tissue with chemo and if it's responsive then I'll receive that treatment, if not it'll be radiotherapy. 

I guess I just want to hear a range of opinions or experiences before I make my decision. On one hand I really want to take part in the trial as it will help research moving forward, but I'm also not sure that it's the best option for me and if it will slow down the process in any way? 

Thank you!"
colomization,1578973729,"And I think my friends/relatives may be sick of my endless questions (they think i’ll be fine) and I feel the need to ask everything in one go

Birads 3 lump around 1.9 centimeters. Found it last November and had to hold off medical tests because of obligations at work. Biopsy has removed the lump and doctor told me to return Monday for the result. 

Questions: 
- is it true that biopsy spreads cancer cells? (Aka am i fucked here on) 
- doctor said she also found blood vessels deep in the lump, is that a bad sign?
- does thermal imaging work better? (I’ve been seeing this group on facebook with a guy admin advising against biopsy, mammograms and chemo and im just so confused right now) 
- lump is sometimes painful. Sometimes it isn’t is it a sign? 
- And if it is cancer, how much is treatment in the philippines? Where can I get all the necessary financial aid? 

I just want to be prepared for all of this. I believe that I’m too you g for cancer and preparing for all the necessary stuff I feel is the way to go. :(Thank u!"
vaisefulu,1578926303,"And I guess I'm kind of spooked. I found a small painful lump on my breast a couple months ago, maybe August or September or something, I went to the doctor I think mid November and because I'm young (26 as of Sunday) with no family history of breast cancer as far as I'm aware and moving through the public healthcare system, its been a bit of a wait till now to get the mammogram appointment time back. 

Initially I was pretty chill about this whole process, thinking I was just being proactive about my health and it would be a cyst, but one worth removing because it's been sore. The lump has been growing however and my breast have changed a lot in density and size (like a whole cup over from mid December to the new year, really quick over two months) lately so it's gotten harder to feel what's going on in there - this is most likely I assume due to coming off birth control and getting my period back (probably worth adding i have a zero percent chance of being pregnant too). This has been okay and hasn't freaked me out too much because i understand the body changes with different hormones going on etc. 

The thing that has really got me worried is the small hard lump in my armpit. It truly is quite small, and it and has been there for maybe 3 or 4 years. I mentioned it once to a flatmate and they said not to worry about it and I basically did just that, and just got used to the feeling of it being there. I didn't even mention it to my doctor at the appointment to get the mammogram set up, it had been there for so long that it was out of mind and I didn't realise it was a symptom of other things, until i mentioned it in passing to someone and they flagged that to me as unusual and potentially worrying in the context of everything else that is going on. Its on the same side of my body that I found the breast lump on (which is the right side, by the way)

Basically I'm spooking myself out now after googling what armpit lumps can mean, especially if they don't go away. I wish i'd mentioned it at my initial appointment but i guess all i can do now is sweat it out until Saturday. Its 3.30sm here on Tuesday morning and I've kind of kept myself up googling symptoms and generally being a worry wart, I don't want to rant at my friends or family and stress them out when surely, everything actually will be fine? And I thought maybe typing it all out here would feel nice and cathartic, and it has actually so that's nice, but also if anyone can provide me with any context, what to worry about and what not to worry about or just any general words of wisdom and advice i would really appreciate it. Thanks anyone still reading"

Docs told me that I would find my energy after 6 months or so.  I'm more tired than ever and both my shoulders and me left upper neck are killing me so tight, constantly sore. Apparently my entire trapezius is tight. My sleep isn't restful and i feel like I have a constant headache.  Furthermore, I travel allot, and ever since my surgery, I feel like I can't drive for more than 2 hours without getting dizzy or losing focus. The only remedy they gave are:

""Exercise more""
I've tried yoga, daily stretching and light cardio for a few months, none of it seems to alleviate the pain, only worsening it.  My upper back would feel so tight, heavy and strained just jogging down the block. The only thing that doesn't aggravate it is walking with me swinging my arms.  Rolling my shoulders give me a little temporary relief. Heat and massage only go so far.

""Low dose muscle relaxers""
They gave it to me on an as needed basis, but it leaves me nothing but a sleeping / zoned out blob.  And it doesn't feel like restful sleep either. Can't get anything done with it.

""Meditate and reduce stress""
Found myself a therapist, she's helped me lower some of my anxiety but not my physical discomfort or my exhaustion.

""Change diet less processed foods""
I've upped my water intake,  more vegetables,  can't do much with fruit or nuts because allergies, cook 9/10 times at home with fresh ingredients. Removed white rice from diet.

My eye doctor can't see anything wrong with my eyes either.

I'm such at such a loss.  Any advice is welcomed. Thank you."
Beating-Gatsby,1578690495,"Hi, I’m Enette and I’m a 38 year old Saffa living in England. It’s not really me to do this as I’m more the private type but I wanted to share my story.

I come from a very remote part of South Africa called Brandvlei, a farming community and my family are sheep farmers. I’ve lived in the UK for 14 years. 

I now work in Finance in London and live with my English partner and two wonderful young girls. 

In December 2019 I was away on my families farm and noticed a lump in my right breast, turns out I have stage 2, grade 3 triple negative breast cancer that has spread to one lymph node. Following the heart breaking news on the 23rd of December we decided to have a great Christmas and tackle this head on in 2020! We kept it quiet from our loved ones, with hindsight I don’t think I’ll ever know if that was the right thing to do...

Anyone that’s been through this will know how hard it is to tell family and children, especially when your parents and siblings are in different countries. This was no different and one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. To lift spirits and start the fight against Gatsby my partner Mark moved a trip to NYC forward and we went off to have an incredible 4 days in a cold but fun packed City on the 2nd of January 2020. I hope one day I will look back on that and truly realize that was when I decided to beat it. 

I now have 16 chemo sessions to do, followed by a possible operation and then radiotherapy. Day one was the 9th of January 2020 and it’s been a slightly outer body experience so far. What I mean by this is, well,  it’s been too easy... I feel naive as I know there are darker days ahead. 

For today though, I’ll take the good days and cross the bridge on the dark days. 

Gatsby by the way is a name we gave CANCER. Read it and say it out loud, cancer. Makes you feel slightly cold and most people look at the floor in this almost child like awkwardness... cancer .. they assume you’re dying or dead. Well, I choose life, I choose to fight, I chose my favorite decade from the Twentieth Century, the 20’s. If I’d live in a decade that’s one I’d have loved to have experienced. 

As we found out I had cancer, we were ending a year, a decade and starting the 20’s. Gatsby seems a fitting name.

Follow me to hear about my fight against Gatsby and share stories, the good ones and not so good ones. I’d love to hear your story too.

Thank you for reading.
Enette, the Gatsby Beater !"
yeeteddudern,1578540280,"Nearly a year and a half ago my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, one known tumor on the left. She took the red devil, went through with a double mastectomy, and finished up with radiation about 3 months ago. She takes Lupron via intramuscular shot monthly, which she goes into the doc for. Among her Daily’s are letrozole,  a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor and levothyroxine synthroid  for radiation induced hypothyroidism. Also, very hopeful, not full blown lymphedema and uses a pump to help with pain where radiation was administered on the left side. 
 Among other things, multiple auto-immune disorders. 

Never been diagnosed depression, slight anxiety and was prescribed Celexa for years before cancer and continues to take to help with symptoms from other medications. 

She took a interest in CBD for its pain relief and to help her manage her stress. 
She rates her constant pain at a 3/10 at its worst 7/10, explaining mostly pain comes from just being uncomfortable all the time and tightness associated with the double mastectomy.

cancerquestion135,1578440178,"Hi everyone, I’m wondering what typical wait times are between an initial appointment and testing. I went in for my annual wellness check about two weeks ago and showed my doctor a lump I had recently found (maybe 1-2 months before - I know I probably should have gone in sooner, it took me a while to find a gyn in my new area). It’s medium/large, but hasn’t changed that I’ve noticed. I’m 24 and she told me it was likely fine but needed an ultrasound to know. Today I had the ultrasound and they found a mass and it’s likely a fibroadenoma, has benign features, but because it was greater than 2.5 centimeters the radiologist recommended a biopsy. It looks like it’ll be about another 2 weeks until I get a biopsy done. Is this a normal/okay amount of wait time? I don’t know how fast this should be moving. Especially as it’s likely nothing. I had appointments offered to me the 21st and 23rd, and the 23rd works better and I doubt two days makes much of a difference. But should I see if they can get me in even sooner than those if they have a waitlist or something? A month from showing my doctor to having a biopsy done just seems like a long time to me..."

I am doing that horrible thing- googling way too much about all my potential bc symptoms before my diagnostic mammogram. This sub has helped me feel some comfort- all the strength and survivors and support etc etc. 

Anyhow ! 

I've had armpit pain for months now. Finally got an ultrasound a month ago. They said they didnt see anything but that my breasts are incredibly dense. (I'm 26. I know youthful breasts are pretty dense- they said mine are especially dense.) 

I let it go. I felt relief. But then about two weeks ago my nipples started changing. My left nipple retracted. It comes back out but even in its 'normal'state it looks different. The pain in my left armpit started happening in the right and I am experiencing a foreign yet persistent pulling/ pain in my left breast. 

I am getting a diagnostic mammogram Thursday. They said they'd let me know the results day of. I apologize if the lack of diagnosis makes this post misplaced on this sub but I am definitely spiraling.

I know it could be anything. It could be other things. And I keep wondering how accurate the ultrasounds actually are? What is the likeliness of a false negative? 

How accurate are diagnostic mammograms?
My body has never changed in this way and I have a lot of skepticism and fear surrounding the accuracy of tests because my symptoms have multiplied and worsened. 

Any advice or experience would be appreciated ! Will relay results Thursday. ♥️"
EveryNameIsTaken314,1578380375,"So, in grade 6, I had gotten my breast cancer shot. Soon after that, I started feeling something in my chest, and I chalked it up to a coincidence, and just told myself that is what they are supposed to feel like. As I've grown up (now graduated), the bumps are the size of a small mandarin orange, but they are exactly the same on both sides, and when I pinch them, it isn't hard, per se, but feels like thick fibres. 

I am absolutely terrified of the doctors, and last time I went (for lower belly pain), they made me take a pregnancy test even after I told them I've never done it. After it came back negative, they told me that they don't know what is wrong, and so I left without learning anything. Now I don't trust them to actually help me, and Google is terrible for this type of question. (I live in a pretty rural area, and it's hard to find a good doctor)

Thanks, and if there is anything else I could let y'all know, please ask me.

I am 5/6ths done with chemo and surgery is the next step for me. I go for an MRI tomorrow to see how much the tumor has shrunk and on the 13th to discuss options with my surgeon. Because of my age and family history (though no genetic factors detected), I'm afraid to say I'm leaning towards a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I wanted to ask what others women's experiences with this are - healing process, scarring, emotions/regrets, implant replacement, tattoos, etc. Whatever you want to share, I want to hear, especially anyone around my age who has been through this. And not to be weird but I'd be interested in pictures too if you'd be willing to share. I found great comfort in photos of u/keepitclassyyy

My biggest fears sound trivial, I know. I've wanted my nipples pierced since I was very young and the possibility obviously goes away with mastectomy. I've also only been with a couple of men and I'm afraid of losing the stimulation from them and fear of if implants feel fake, how much they can withstand, etc. I'm not so much afraid if feeling unattractive to men, but to myself.

And a second to vent: one of the most frustrating reactions I get is ""you're so young!"" I get it, it's shocking because it is uncommon in younger women, but it's alienating which is the last thing I need."

littlepalmtrees,1578231650,"Hello everyone,
a few months ago I accidentally hurt my nipple when I removed a Band-Aid I put next to it to cover a pimple that was bleeding.
So then I decided to put ointment and cover the wound with a Band-Aid too.
Well it's been month's and the wound still hasn't recovered, sometimes a little skin covers it but it gets easily removed during bath or even just wearing clothes.
The wound suddenly migrated to my other nipple.. which started to worry me because I didn't hurt this one. 

It's like a wound, releases a clear liquid that is a bit yellowish, it seems like this forms the skin I mentioned is removed easily. I also think I should mention I'm pretty used to having pimples in my breast area, and this is definitely not a pimple.

I'm a teenager, and the place I live is pretty complicated to get access to a gynecologist being my age. I'm really unsure and worried and I hope you guys can help me.

FathersChild,1578176885,"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, the lump is removed already, and I'm about to get further treatment soon.

So far, I've told family and close friends about the diagnosis and while it was more or less shocking for everyone, it definitely helps me to talk openly about this.

Now I'm wondering whether or not it's OK to communicate this openly to friends that are less close to me, for example contacts from the gym or the pub.

**Pros:** I wouldn't need to beat around the bush, which would be more comfortable to me. For example if ppl would ask me about my Christmas holidays, I could openly tell that I was in hospital and wouldn't need to make things up. Similar for the upcoming treatments that might impact me. 
In addition, I've already made the experience that being open encourages others to share their experiences, which I consider beneficial in most cases.

**Cons:** Many people feel uncomfortable talking about serious illnesses or death, and I'm afraid of losing social contacts, when people start avoiding me to avoid the topic. I also don't want to be ""the one with cancer"". Yes, it is part of my life now and plays a role, but I'm more than that and don't want it to be the only topic. Furthermore, I don't want to trigger something in others. Maybe they've lost someone to cancer recently...

Did you share the diagnosis with people that are not so close to you? How did you tell them? And how did it turn out in the end?"

dmscvan,1577838600,"Hi. I am currently waiting for a surgery date (late January), and I feel like there’s so much that I don’t understand. I wonder if anyone could help me think of anything else I should be asking my nurse navigator at this point. (I need to decide between a lumpectomy or mastectomy before surgery.)

I found a lump in July and didn’t go to the doctor until October. (Stupid, on my part - I’m 42, with no family history and my mom had a couple benign lumps removed when she was my age. Plus, I had to cross a border to get to a doctor in English.)

I had an ultrasound and FNA at my first appointment. The results suggested malignancy, but she said I would probably just need a lumpectomy and that was it. Nevertheless, she wrote me an 8 week note so I could move home for treatment. (I would have had the surgery there, but I was already resigning and would have had to go to a place with a lot of political instability for treatment, so I decided to come home to Canada.)

When I got here, I basically had to start again. Ultrasound, mammogram, core needle biopsy. The results came back and I have IDC, grade 2. I don’t have the HER2 type. The tumor is 4.3 cm (though the ultrasound said 2.9 - maybe the mammogram showed it differently?). I’ve been told that after surgery, I will need chemo (because of the size - but they won’t know details until after the surgery). Then I will need radiation if I get a lumpectomy and probably won’t need it if I get a mastectomy (though it depends on the margins). I will also have lymph nodes removed for testing and after all this will likely be on hormone treatment for 10 years. 

I’m currently staying with my parents. We live far out of the city, so it’s hard to get to support groups/other resources. (I’m working on getting a car, because my parents have their own health concerns - I want to be able to drive in myself when able to.)

When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t do much research on it. I didn’t want to stress myself out getting stuck down an internet rabbit hole until I knew more. Plus, I had to suddenly pick up and move nine years of my life and my dog and I overseas. Since I found out it’s more serious, I haven’t been able to (emotionally) do the kind of reading I normally would (I’m an academic and would usually do as much research as possible). 

My nurse navigator is great and I can call her anytime. I’m just overwhelmed and hardly know where to start. If anybody could help give my advice on what I should be asking, I would really appreciate it!! Thank you. (Sorry this post is so long!)"
NemoWiggy124,1577820079,"Here is the full story with my questions at the bottom:

My wife (30/f) found a lump on her left breast back near the end of October. She got a mammogram and ultrasound in November from a breast surgeon, he stated there was an area of concern to biopsy it just to be safe. She got a core needle biopsy and the report came back positive for DCIS &amp; IDC. The report read the tumor size as 1.2 cm x 1.0 cm x 0.9 cm. They informed us the tumor was small 6 mm and was clinically a stage I with ER+ (100%) PR+ (95%) &amp; Her2-, grade 2. Lymph nodes looked good and didn't see any other areas of concern.

Of course this was a big shock with lots of tears and sadness especially being on the younger side. Surgery was the plan, a bilateral mastectomy was scheduled for January (my wife didn't want to live with the anxiety) and an immediate reconstruction following with expanders than implants. Scheduling was tough due to the holidays.

We are from a smaller area so I mentioned we should possibly get a second opinion just to be safe in a bigger city to see if we get the same results.

Second breast surgeon wanted her to get an MRI, which we got locally and out of the area, to get another look at what was going on and see if she needed anymore tests. During this time we met with 2 oncologists, 3 breast surgeons, and 2 plastics surgeons. 

The MRI came back with more areas of concern and the original tumor was 2.8 cm (NOT 6mm) with areas now on her right breast, a smaller area near the original tumor, and an enlarged lymph node under the left armpit nearest the big tumor. Biopsies were taken now of the right breast and left lymph node. The right came back benign but the lymph node came back positive 16mm x 14mm x 9mm. 

She is really scared now thinking that the treatment will involve chemo with a T2 size tumor and N1 positive node. Surgery isn't till next week and we won't get full pathological results till 01/20. 

Does anyone have any advice on what the best processes are with this early diagnosis? I think the surgery is a positive for she just wants the tumor removed but we are both very anxious for the treatment options. They are still up in the air post surgery especially when:

Surgeon A: small tumor, suggested mastectomy/double only hormone therapy
Surgeon B: hormone tumor, no need to worry, lumpectomy/radiation, or mastectomy, or bilateral, our choice for surgery, hormone therapy or chemo depending on lymph nodes post surgery
Surgeon C: agreed with bilateral mastectomy for her ease of anxiety, hormone or chemo depending on other nodes

Will the Ocnotype DX or Recurrence Score have any implication on her treatment? I've been studying and reading scientific journals like crazy and that tumor characteristics like it's genome may play more a factor then positive/negative lymph nodes.

I know this is still all up in the air till after her surgery, but we don't have any children and we were just about to start trying before we got this news so it caused more a bigger blow back if chemo is in the equation. We've been working with a fertility specialist and are in the process of getting her AMH levels checked for freezing embryos just in case, but just seems we keep getting bad news around every corner. 

I know that was a lot of information, just feel so bad that my wife has to go through this. I know she is strong but can tell it's taking it's toll on her mentally, from a small hormone tumor, to now bigger tumor, lymph node, surgery, and possibly chemo. Wish I could trade spots and take some of the burden so she wouldn't have to go through this. Any advice, insight, answers, or help would be greatly appreciated!"
Imadeanaccforthat,1577584976,"Good evening, since 3 days ago i felt a pain similar to a pinch underneath my breast, tought nothing much of it it was just painfull when i was touching the area, this evening I notice that when I lift my arm above my head a indent form on my breast, like a line, similar as is i had something pressing on it, and it disapear when i lower my arm. There is no lump in it, but now its painful because I really touched my breast hard to see if there was anything.. I know it might be many things and I am not looking for a diagnosis on reddit, im gonna call doctors office on Monday, but I need a bit of help to rationalise it all, is it something that is really heard of? Cause i have never seen it before . Thank you"
josiebreen,1577542482,"Hi there,

Yesterday I had my very first mammogram as I turned 40 a few months ago. The tech was very kind and she explained that she wanted to get some extra pictures since it was my first time and they need to get a baseline. When we were done she showed me the images on the screen and mentioned that I have dense tissue and should consider talking to my doctor about ultrasounds.

As an aside, I stopped breastfeeding a week and a half before the mammogram. My baby is 12 months old so I was barely nursing him (just right before bed so I’m not even sure how much milk he was actually getting) 

I am pretty convinced that when they call me on Monday I will be asked to come back. Will they do an ultrasound or will I have to talk to my dr about referring me for one? I do not have any of the typical risk factors (specific genes or lose family members with BC) so I am wondering what additional screenings I’d even be able to get without paying out of pocket, etc. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? I’ve been looking online but I see conflicting things about the whole dense tissue thing. I’m very confused."

dmscvan,1577403341,"Hi. I will be going for surgery in a few weeks (the date isn’t set yet), but I was looking at what type of bra I would need to get. I found these ones by Prairie Wear that say are a “Post-Surgical &amp; Active Recovery Bra and Binder in one”, but also say they’re a compression bra. I emailed them and they said that they “it will work for you post-surgically  through PT and recovery and into every day support.  Post-Surgical applies to any breast surgery including a Lumpectomy, Mastectomy, Reconstruction, etc.”. They also say that they’re for Lymphedema (I will be having lymph nodes removed, so I guess this may be a risk). 

My question is - what is the compression actually for? Just for normal support? (I have a D cup, and probably will need something if I have a lumpectomy.) I’m trying to decide if I should just go ahead and order something. 

I know it would be easier to just talk to someone in a store, but I moved back home from overseas for treatment, and I don’t yet have my own vehicle and live an hour out of the city. I’m trying to do as much as I can online, because it’s difficult to get in at the moment. I do plan on going in to some of the support resources, but I want to make sure I have appropriate stuff to wear for after surgery and don’t want it to get lost in the shuffle of everything else I have to do. 

To be honest, I haven’t processed much of this (I initially thought I would just need a lumpectomy, but I just found out that I will need chemo and probably radiation too, plus the removal of lymph nodes. I’m still overwhelmed with the idea of choosing between a lumpectomy and mastectomy, but will make us of the resources that they sent to help with the decision.) I think looking into bras right now is just one thing I feel like I can maybe do while I’m taking everything in. 

Sorry. This post is maybe way to long for a simple question about bras, I’m just overwhelmed. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks."
Sshibal_my_life,1577391063,"I posted a few days ago about being freaked out over a 45 minute MRI-guided biopsy. I was diagnosed was breast cancer back in October and during my first MRI they found a second suspicious mass in my other breast. The ultrasound couldn't pick it up, so I was scheduled for an MRI-guided biopsy.

So this morning was my MRI-guided biopsy and as soon as my face went down into the head rest I knew I wouldn't last 45 minutes. This MRI was different than my first. My first one had two mirrors in the area where you put your face so I was able to see the room in front of me. This MRI had nothing to look at, just a white table one inch from my face. They put noise cancelling headphones on me which only made me feel more isolated. Then they put heavy blankets on my legs that felt like they were restricting my movement. At this point I was uncomfortable, but still willing to do the MRI. However once I started realizing that I wouldn't be able to get out immediately because a needle would be protruding from my boob, I sat up and told the doctor that I didn't think I would last 45 minutes. She tried to encourage me, so I attempted to convince myself that everything would be ok, but after about 10 minutes I sat back up (this is while they were adjusting everything) and told her that I couldn't handle 45 minutes of laying still while being physically unable to sit up in case I started to panic.

It was mostly the lack of control that freaked me out. The first MRI sucked, but I always knew I could jump outta there if I wanted to. I've never been in a situation that made me feel claustrophobic until now. I asked about medication, but my doctor didn't think it was necessary since I've never taken anti-anxiety medication or muscle relaxers before.

Apparently my only options are to either schedule another MRI/biopsy with medication or have the surgeon remove it. The radiologist kept saying to me today ""This is your only option. Trust me, you don't want the surgeon to do it."" But being under anesthesia sounds wonderful compared to this. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? Is it a good idea to let the surgeon do it instead? I feel pretty confident that I wouldn't be able to handle a MRI-guided biopsy again."

randomusername1919,1577212560,"Found out I have breast cancer, the biopsy missed it but I had the lump out anyway as it was causing pain.  Pathology cam back as cancer.  Now the surgeon wants to go back and remove lymph nodes for testing, which I am told will give a lifetime risk of lymphedema.  What if I get breast cancer again?  Following the second surgery, I was told I would have radiation and maybe chemo, then hormone therapy for 10 years.  I had a really bad reaction to the pill, so messing with hormones concerns me.  One doc I was referred to did such a harsh breast exam three weeks after my lumpectomy that I had grab mark bruises on my breast and now it is healing into a different shape.  It was healing very nicely before.  I have never had anyone grab and crush a breast as part of a breast exam, so I am completely freaked out on all things medical now, wondering if the next doctor I am referred to will also cause physical harm.

Cancer is a dreaded disease that is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Cancer also negatively affects the quality of life of patients. Moreover, cancer therapy can produce several side effects, which can further affect the patient’s day-to-day life. In such a scenario, adequate nutrition is a crucial element for cancer patients. A proper diet can boost the patient’s overall health, thereby improving the patient’s quality of life. Evidence suggests that a ketogenic diet could be beneficial for cancer patients and assist with cancer therapy.

I'm (38f) BRCA1 +ve, Breast cancer survivor (7+ years). Stage 2C, spread to lymphnodes. Had a mastectomy, chemo, radiation the works! A year later had ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (oompharectomy) to prevent ovarian cancer. Have been menopausal since 31. 

Recently they found some abnormalities in my other breast and I'm headed for a second biopsy this year. I'm done and fed-up of MRIs, CTscans, doc visits and biopsies every six months and the anxiety of what will the the report show ?! 

My aim is to ask for mastectomy of the other breast and then go for a TRAP or DIEM Flap reconstruction for both the older mastectomy and the newer one where they might be able to save some skin. nipple of new one will need to go unforts.. the older had major scarring and tissue damage, plus it's a shade darker due to intense radiation. 

My questions to those who might have done reconstruction using body muscle/ fat  before are ... 

What is the time to recovery post surgery especially if both breasts are being reconstructed together  ? 
I have a desk, client facing job - how soon can I go back to work? 
Any complications to lookout for after surgery?
Will I need more surgery after the reconstruction? Trying to stay away from hospitals.. 
Anyone experience after 5-10 years? Any long term effects to think about ? 
What happens if I lose or gain weight ? 
How soon can I exercise post surgery? Should I start now ( not very fit) and get fit before the surgery? 
Anything else I should think about ?"
MissBoomey,1576326908,"So this post is just me seeing if anyone had something similar , if it’s concerning ... I had pus and slight blood from both breasts, primarily one though , couple years ago after I lost 25 lbs . I went and got ultrasound and they found some thing , then I followed up in 6 months and another doc found something with vascularity in it and advised to get biopsy, however it was just a recommendation because they don’t know what it means, slightly concerning. However I only had pus for about a month and then it never showed up. For 2.5 years I had no issues and now breast has slight pus again . I have a bunch of fibrous tissue because I’m obese and have no periods. One of the doc said that those sore lumpiness that I ocassionaly have(not accompanied by pus) is due to whacky hormones. So I thought pus is whacky hormones. I will have to get ultrasound in couple months(no money right now) as a follow up . I did gain 50 lbs in past 2 years so thinking it has something to do with that ...

I have this bright pink spot right next to my nipple on my left breast. I did the usual breast self exam and feel no lumps. Just my usual glands and such. The pink spot is a little bigger than a quarter but it seems to be only on the surface. There is a /tiny/ pimple-type bump forming in the middle of one of my hair follicles next to the nipple. It does hurt if I press on it, but not much; and it hurts like a pimple hurts when you touch it.

This is the first time I’ve experienced this and I wanted to ask if this is a pimple on my breast or something worse? This spot wasn’t there in the morning so it must have happened sometime in the past few hours.

I also have a cat and there are five little pricks about five inches above the spot, that are a lot like my cats paw (they are grabby), so it might even be related to that.

Basically, should I be worried or is it a pimple? Should I wait or rush to the doctor? I have an appointment in a month, would it be safe to wait if this spot disappears in a day or two?

Mom-of-everyone,1575571840,"I started steps to get a breast reduction because I have abnormally large and quite painful breasts (34I) and it's really hurting my back and neck. I tried to do some by losing weight, but it hurts to even go to the gym like this and haven't even been able to go down a full cup size despite getting down to a size 6 jeans from a 16. 

They sent me for all the fun preliminaries like my very first mammogram, which came back with several masses. After the ultrasounds and additional imaging, they want a needle biopsy now. Also, the surgeon is saying that the inevitable lumpectomy and reduction (if I can still get it) will be separate procedures. That means on top of the biopsy recovery (outpatient), 2 recovery times from surgery, and even more time off work. 

As much as I can't afford it, I feel like both are necessary procedures. One so I don't die, the other so I can have less pain and hopefully function like a normal person.

All that to ask this...has anyone here had a needle biopsy and how bad was it? Was it painful...like should I count on a couple days off from that too?

Has anyone had a lumpectomy and how bad was the recovery? My lump is about 1.5 cm and almost perfectly centered in the middle of my boob if that makes a difference.

Has anyone had a subsequent reduction or reconstruction and how bad was the recovery from that?

(30y/o female) I went in for a breast exam yesterday, as I had found a lump that I’ve had for a year or so and just recently got insurance to be able to get it checked out. The lump is in the 4 o’clock position (inner lower) in my right boob, so not the usual spot one finds a lump. 

In my left boob, I have clear (maybe with a tinge of orange, but didn’t mention the color to my dr bc I couldn’t confirm the color, just that it wasn’t opaque) discharge occasionally from what seems to be only one duct. Not a lot, but sometimes my nipped gets crusted because of it. I noticed it when doing a self exam and squeezing it. 

My doctor was able to feel the lump I was talking about and didn’t seem too concerned and said it is probably normal breast tissue. She did want to further investigate it tho and scheduled me for a mammogram and an ultrasound for next week. 

She also wanted to have the discharged looked into, even tho she wasn’t able to see it while I was there. I had blood work done to test my thyroids and prolactin levels today.

I am in my first year doing breast cancer research and wanted to explore correlations between partner salivary content and breast cancer. In other words is there something in a partners saliva that over the long term, may contribute to breast cancer.  

There is currently no scientific research suggesting that there is a connection between breast cancer and salivary content.  And from a scientific perspective there is no reason to assume there is a connection between the two. However I wanted to explore the topic and see if there is anything to be learned. 

I hope it's ok with the community that I am posting this. If people are unhappy about it, please lmk and I will remove the post.

metastatic_mindy,1575327639,"Well December is here and Christmas is only 23 days away. This year feels very surreal.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is. I feel like sept, oct and nov just flew by. Maybe it is the being faced. With my own mortality that makes time seem to zip by.  Time is something we all think about daily. Our daily lives are dictated by time. We set alarms, make and attend appointments, plan events and decide what we do with our day based off how much time we have. We probably check to see what day it is at least once daily and check what time it is many times daily and yet we rarely think of time beyond the now and near present. 

For me, I am acutely aware of time. Of course in all the same ways as everyone else but also on a level many of you hopefully will never have to think about. 

In feb 2018 I was told the cancer had progressed to a point that my life would be over long long before it should be. At that time we assumed that I was in the last year, maybe even months of my life. It was devastating.  Since then I have tried to live as full a life as possible but this is hard to do. 

You see, I live my life in tiny increments of time. It is hard to plan when you don't have an expectation of being alive in the foreseeable future. I tend to live and plan in 3 months increments, basically from scan to the next scan, hoping that I am going to defy the odds once again and get the ""all clear, no progression!"". Each time is bitter and sweet. 

The explanation for this is extremely difficult to talk about and even much more difficult for people to understand, unless they too are living their lives in these tiny increments of time. 

The sweet is the easy and the obvious. The sweet is the good news. The news that we have another 3 months to plan and live and at times pretend our lives are normal and just like everyone elses. We try to attend to as many responsibilities as possible. We try to fill our lives and the lives of those around us with memories and experiences and love and light and of course life. 

The bitter. Well it is much harder to explain because no one and I really mean no one wants to experience progression. Having progression usually means tossing out the current line of treatment and starting something new. This means new side effects which are usually harsher than the last side effects. This means a new routine and usually less effective treatment, more testing more often and in general it is messes with ones mental and emotional well being. 

The bitter comes from the knowledge that this horrible rollercoaster of disease is not over. That we must now endure even more time that usually involves mentally, emotionally and physically painful experiences, procedures and medications. 

It isn't that we want to die, but rather we just want the disease and all the horrible things it brings to end. 

I think that this is a normal thing to feel but no one talks about it. Usually because it upsets those around us. It upsets society and it bursts their bubble of ""bravery and strength"" that others have decided all cancer patients should exude. 

I say it not because I WANT to die, but I also don't want to suffer. We all have our limits to the amount of pain and suffering we are willing to endure and we also all have the ability to push that envelope a little bit further than we ever thought possible, however at some point the envelope gets pushed over the edge. 

I also made a promise to myself that I wouldn't lie, sugar coat or pretend about any part of my cancer experience and for some reason this particular topic has been floating around in my mind. Now I am no where near feeling the end of my story is near... But I have been blessed with time when so sooo many others have not. This brings for me a whole other bitter sweet.  The sweetness of more time but also a bitterness of a sort of survivor's guilt. Knowing that I get to have more time while others do not. Knowing that I have now been on my 1st line of treatment for 22 months when most average maybe 12-18 months. 

I know my time on 1st line is almost up and that changes in my treatments is just around the corner and so I am left with trying to figure out ""how do I deal with a progression when it does finally happen?"""

shhleeping,1574847007,"Hi, I'm a 21F and found a dense lump in my breast a few months ago. It's right against my chest wall and not visible but very obvious to the touch. It's been estimated to be around 1.5cm or so; I'd say when I ""grip"" it, the whole mass seems around the size of a large egg yolk... 

I got an ultrasound for it and was thankfully told that it's most likely benign with the key characteristics of being moveable, round/regular in shape. The technician let me know that I had a choice between scheduling a biopsy or meeting with a breast surgeon to talk about surgical removal; I wanted it out right away and opted for the latter.  


Today I had my appointment and the surgeon offered me the same options. I let her know immediately that I wanted it removed as soon as possible. She circled back to the option of going for a biopsy first, and then see what my options are. I would have to deal with the procedure and then return every few months to receive ultrasounds to keep the lump in check. I'm on very good (expensive, mandatory) college student insurance right now so the surgery would be free. I graduate in a few months and would have to deal with returning for ultrasounds that would no longer be covered. I'm 98% confident that this really is nothing; my mom had a scare once and had her breast biopsied and returned negative, but I saw her suffer through the recovery with leakage, heavy bruising, general pain for at least a week or two. No other family history that I know of (East Asian). I insisted that I'd just prefer it removed because of these reasons and that I'm seriously not interested in keeping it in whether we find out it's suspicious or not. She kept circling around back to biopsy first is a better option and then said things about how it would be preferable to avoid unnecessary surgery and that it would leave an ""unpleasant"" scar. I've seen footage of similar surgical procedures and especially since mine is obvious and right against the surface, I'm not that concerned.   


We just kept going on this weird back and forth like she was an NPC in a game that offers you options and then doesn't let you choose it. In the end, she said that the procedures might look different for removal depending on what they find in the biopsy, so it'd be a good idea to have it before the surgery anyway. I just conceded and left, and I know I was being the most stubborn and assertive I've ever been in a medical setting, but I'm kind of upset that she had to speak negatively of the surgery and the scarring considering she'd be the one taking care of it... I'm also concerned that she might not actually go through with surgery afterwards and we'd have to do this roundabout again because she said mine is pretty small and not visible so it doesn't even matter anyway. Not to be vain, but it's EXTREMELY obvious with a slight touch over it and I'd rather not have me or SO have to run into it all the time. My SO is fine with whatever I do, but I am personally very uncomfortable with it.  


Now I'm left to make the biopsy appointment and I'm really stupidly upset over this. Is what she said true? Would the surgery be that different? I heard biopsies for lumps close to the chest wall hurt more, not sure if that's true either... I'd consider myself quite pain intolerant, and the thought of going through two recoveries and two scars instead of a likely finalized one is really scary. I'd really appreciate anyone's opinion on this: either that she's right and I'm being silly, or that these are reasons enough to take some other action. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, I wasn't sure where else to go. I really am unsure about all this, please help."
personificate,1574740897,"Hey everyone, advice needed

I took my mother to a surgeon today who said her lump was too large for a standard lumpectomy and she could have a masectomy or go on chemo for a few months then have the lumpectomy. It has grown a lot since the summer, when she was first aware of a lump.

She is uninsured. To complicate things, she just lost her job last month. She earns 34k a year. More than the Medicaid allowance even with breast cancer option (200% of federal poverty). To complicate things further, she has not filed her tax returns for 8 years after her divorce. She told me she didn't know how to do them and just didn't do them. This disqualifies her from [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) open enrollment right now, the subsidy portion. The cheapest plan she can get is $725 and doesn't cover anything. She only has enough personal savings to get her through December, without any medical costs. She cannot afford $700+ plans in any capacity after her rent, food, and car insurance etc. 

I am here asking if anyone knows of any program or anything that can help her financial situation so she can get care ASAP. 

Most groups will not see her without some form of upfront payment or insurance.

The surgeon today is going to do a new biopsy tomorrow which is cash $400. Lab tests are billed later. 

Any suggestions, programs, help, advice, is more than appreciated.  Thank you."
TomatoPotatoRob,1574736214,"Hi. I am curious if there are any resources based on low income for treatment that I am able to qualify for.   
This article is disheartening to say the least:  [https://www.kqed.org/stateofhealth/104264/cancer-patients-on-medi-cal-do-worse-than-those-with-other-insurance](https://www.kqed.org/stateofhealth/104264/cancer-patients-on-medi-cal-do-worse-than-those-with-other-insurance) 

I currently reside in California, and am on the Medi-Cal insurance plan where I make less than 35,535 a year for a family of 3. My daughter is dependent, and my husband works part time. 

I am a small business owner bringing in about 15k a year, and my husband brings in about the same amount.

This year, it looks like I will just be over the 35,535 mark if I continue to operate my business. Given that I was diagnosed with breast cancer on Medi-cal, if I were to switch insurance providers to a more expensive plan (but better), does this count as a pre-existing condition towards another health insurance provider?

Or should I stop working in order to meet income requirements just to continue to qualify for Medi-Cal?

I've seen several threads here and there mentioning to reach out to the hospital billing department directly and ask for financial aid. When I start treatment, I believe my income will be around 20k. Would the insurance company expect to take my entire income? Or do they based the co-pay and premiums on your income level?   
I believe I've also come across an article mentioning there is a company that will offer to house keep/cleaning for free for existing breast cancer patients.  
Any other similar resources?"
PensiveHufflepuff,1574677877,"My mum had a mastectomy done almost a month ago now and today we found out that they removed all the tumor during the mastectomy and that it hasn't spread.

They asked her if she wanted to have surgery done to remove the affected lymph nodes and of course she said yes. The doctor apparently told them that after this operation she'll be cancer free.

throwaway37743829,1574669030,I’m starting to get worried. Within the past few months my left breast (previously operated on to remove a benign lump when I was 16 if that matters) has been giving me intense pain. I’ve been checked for heart problems just in case it was internal. I was prescribed anti inflammatories but they haven’t worked. Is breast pain a potential symptom? I don’t feel another lump so far but is this enough to get checked out for?
studentnurse13,1574635137,"So about 2 weeks ago I found a lump that I only could feel while laying down. So I went online and scheduled an appointment at my OB/GYN the next week. At the appointment, my Dr. instructed me to raise my arms during the exam and this revealed two large, hard, non-painful lumps. I asked him what they could be. He said since I am only 21 he is not worried and that it is most likely a fibroma and he doesn't think they are cysts because they are hard. But because they are rather large he is going to schedule an ultrasound and biopsy. The next available appointment isn't until next week and I can't stop googling and thinking the worst. I am in college 3 states away from my family so I have to go to this appointment alone..

I only know half of my family history and on that half there is no breast cancer at all. I was fine for the first few days but as it's getting closer I'm having mini panic attacks and can't stop shaking that I'm going to have cancer. I don't know of anything who has ever had to go through with this so it is all new territory. I also have lost 15 lbs the past 3 months without trying and have read that is often the first sign of cancer in the body... I know I need to remain optimistic but this whole waiting thing is driving me nuts !!"

registani,1574626353," Breast Cancer Survivor Facts and Fictions  
Lymph node removal during breast cancer [surgery](http://www.treatmentsofcancer.com/tag/surgery) can lead to lymphedema—painful limb swelling that can become chronic. But much advice given to survivors isn’t backed by solid medical evidence, according to Babak Mehrara, MD, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. 

 **Common Advice**      
Watch your weight.  
Don’t lift your arms above your head.  
Take special precautions when you fly.  
Stay away from heat and heat treatments.  
Skip vigorous exercise.

**Fact Or Fiction?**  
Fact. Being overweight or obese doubles the risk of getting lymphedema.  
Fiction. No need to wear, for example, special constriction sleeves. Flying is safe.  
Fiction. It’s not backed by evidence.  
Fiction. On the contrary, some evidence indicates that heat [therapy](http://www.treatmentsofcancer.com/tag/therapy) can actually reduce limb swelling.  
Fiction. The opposite is true! Engage in both aerobic exercise and resistance training, which help offset symptoms regardless of whether weight loss occurs. For best results, combine with an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean [diet](http://www.treatmentsofcancer.com/tag/diet) rich in tomatoes, legumes and seafood."

Boobstuff,1574534806,"TLDR; radiologist could find no clear target to biopsy, dont know if referred to surgeon for no reason.

I think i am in a weird spot because i found a lump, went to dr and she referred me for diagnostic mammo. I had mammo and ultrasound and the radiologist said first that something was abnormal and that he didnt know what it was and that there was no clear target to biopsy. he could either refer me to a surgeon or i could wait 6 months and see if anything changed. Then he asked if i had any nipple discharge and i told him about the one time watery discharge i had. 

I get the mammogram results and it says there is a benign fibroadenoma however there is architectural distortion, thickening of skin in subareolar region and questionable tissue effacement i dont know what any of that means other than the word benign which i take to mean that i am all good. It said BIRADS 4.

Under his recommendations he put that he recommended that i see a breast surgeon but that i didnt seem to understand and he asked my primary to explain to me what he recommended.

My primary said that i need to consult the surgeon to see if i should get an mri or if there is anything to biopsy.

I am really really nervous about seeing the surgeon because the radiologist was kind of....rude to me and made it seem like i was there for no reason even though i can feel ropey weird tissue in my boob that is totally different from the other boob. My chest hurts too, not my boob, but like...the bone behind it or ribs or whatever is behind my boob im not sure what hurts it just does.

I just dont want to be made to feel like i am at the surgeon for no reason the way the radiologist acted because i was under the impression that if something was actually there, the radiologist would have done the biopsy when i was there for mammo and ultrasound.

Basically i want to know if this is normal because i really dont want to seem like i am demanding something from them when they are telling me nothing is wrong."
Bedheadredhead30,1574493250,"Hello all! I'm 34 years old and two days ago, my doctor found a suspicious lump in my left breast. Today I had the first half of my diagnostic mammogram and I was told I have extremely  dense breast tissue (category D) which is associated with a higher chance of developing breast cancer. The radiologist told me the lump is difficult to see but is most likely just a cyst or fibroadenoma. I will have the U/S on monday to further evaluate. 

I do not know my family hx, I was adopted as a newborn, birth mother was only 15 so the medical questionnaire she filled out stating ""I have no hx of breast cancer "" is pretty useless. There is no record of the birth mothers family hx available. 

Where do I go from here? I would like to have genetic testing done but my insurance will not cover it without a family/ personal hx of breast cancer (wtf???) Have any of you considered a  prophylactic mastectomy based on similar circumstances? If I'm being honest, I'm not all that attached to my breasts and I would rather just have them removed if it means my chances improve. 

Any advice? Thank you in advance!"

butterfly_in_chains,1574418342,"I went for a memo. 2 years ago I had s lump under my left arm ultra sounded. I never heard anything back. So life went on. I have multiple auto immune and chronic pain issues and am on a fairly low dose of time relief morphine for many years.
They did the memo and before I could get my robe back on thevradiologistvwas in the room. 2 more angles. Then off to ultra sound. Same thing. Calcification they said.
I cannot be frozen locally due to allergies so off to the breast surgeon. On Oct 4th ,I had a third of my left breast removed.3 weeks later I finally got results. They got in and found a 9 cm tumor inside my main duct and eratic cells farther out than they thought they would. So surgery no 2 is booked for Nov 5th. Nov 1st I went to see the Dr in thenemerg because I had clear dark pinkish fluid slowly leaking from my surgical sight. He took a seen and it opened a flood gate. Filling multiple dressings very quickly,right up to the next surgery. 
The day before surgery the injected a radio active dye into my breast to light up my lymph node that were involved and the one under my arm was as bright as it's own sun. The other thing I noticed was that thruout my breast there was a galaxies of very bright spots.  Not sure what that meant.
I bounced back from surgery 1 fairly quickly but this time I am TIRED.
I get shooting pains that take my breath away ,some have even made me cry out. Pain doesn't usually do that to me and I can take a lot. During surgery 2 they took another 1/3 of my breast tissue. They did say I would have to start radiation,but I still don't have an oncologist. Or the results from surgery 2. I am more scared than I have ever been. I have questions. Why didn't they see a 9 cm tumor? Why didn't they know that the surgeon was going to have to fillet my breast in surgery one? I am so scared. I need to know what's going to happen next. I need to know why i am so tired. I am terrified surgery 2 showed faster spreading. How long do pathology reports take?

pclaradactyl,1574407444,"I am 27. Diagnosed with stage 2, triple negative, IDC. Learned I have a genetic factor Li Fraumeni  Syndrome (LFS) which basically means my lifetime risk of all cancers is higher (I inherited a broken tumor prevention gene, it’s super rare, there’s like no clear protocol for anything and all the doctors are basically flying blind when identifying it’s implications which I think is why I’m in this situation now). Cancer never  spread to my lymph nodes, so no plans for radiation. 

I haven’t had kids yet, but want them someday. I’m currently single. 

We did my mastectomy on Friday (last week). Given my family history and genetic risk of additional cancer in my life it seemed like the choice. In making my plan, we originally planned to do analogous tissue for reconstruction with my thigh and ab. My surgeon was so enthusiastic and it gave me a lot of confidence in my post-surgery outcome. She even suggested I might have nerve reconnection and light touch sensation after. My mind was blown. 

At my first post-op appointment she’s kinda had a change of heart. It started with us questioning if I needed the CT scan for her to see blood vessels when she mentioned it after visiting me post-surgery (I’m supposed to avoid them if possible, but I can do one if necessary). She said she’d look into it. She did, but now she is strongly recommending I do implants instead. So many reasons, which I guess became apparent after she considered how my genetic factor played in—maybe it forced her to look at big picture? I dunno. I’m honestly mega confused. I thought we had discussed most of it in September and she was selling my on analogous tissue at the time. But now it’s completely flipped. It’s a long recovery, I can get back to my life sooner with implant, results are better for the donor site if you’ve had kids already, if I need a future surgery in my abdomen it’ll be harder (a concern for an abdominal cancers I’m at higher risk for, I think this is her biggest concern), why do so many surgeries on someone in their 20s, no need to CT scan, etc. It was really surreal because she also kept emphasizing that she never recommends this—she normally is persuading people to do analogous—but after my question about LFS she spent all week reconsidering it and she really thinks my best overall quality of life choice is the implant and is strongly urging me to switch. 

I’m just so heartbroken. I had a plan. And now a week post-mastectomy it’s possibly changed. I was sold on the plan an enthusiastic to get through it... and now I have tissue expanders in, drains tied around my waist and I’m supposed to reconsider it? I made this decision in September. I went into my mastectomy with no real concerns or worries because I felt so confident moving forward, but now AFTER the mastectomy I have to reconsider all this. 

My surgeon is amazing. I still love her and appreciate her being honest with me. She’s incredibly apologetic too. So I’m not mad at her really. I’m just so frustrated and confused. 

I’m posting to ask about people’s experience? 

* Has anyone used analogous tissue before having kids and having them later? Was the tightness post-reconstruction really that problematic? She said the youngest she’s done this surgery is 31 on someone with no plans for more kids. That seemed like a big factor. 
* How do the implants compare to tissue expanders? 
* Is the analogous tissue surgery really that bad recovery-wise? I’m in between grad school and applying for a job now so I have this window of no responsibilities that seemed ideal for an invasive procedure to suck up months of my life (living with mom, so not worried about finances).
* What are people’s experience with dating post-implants? I don’t know why but I felt more confident with the idea of it being my tissue.., but now that might be a different story. 
* I was really sold on analogous tissue. Can someone try to sell me on implants? Some of my frustration is that it feels like a downgrade, but maybe I just need help reframing it. 

No decisions been made.  We haven’t scheduled reconstruction yet. I’m gonna push on her for a better understanding at what changed from when we made the plan to now. I think that’ll help me if I understand better what triggered her to change her mind. But having some input from people who’ve done it will really help I think."

I’ve had shocking symptoms all year which are unaccounted for (fatigue, night sweats) but recently I started to notice the tissue on the outer side of my chest was uneven on both sides. 

It’s hard to describe, but it’s swollen on my left side, vertically in line with the armpit, horizontally in line with my left breast. 

It’s about twice as big as the same tissue on the other side. Last night I couldn’t sleep on my left side without being bothered by the tenderness. It feels bruised almost, but it’s not. 

I also, about a month ago, noticed very mild swelling just under my left breast, towards the top of my rib cage. 

My left breast is bigger than my right, and this hasn’t always been the case but it isn’t an entirely new thing. I have had a weird rash on my nipples before, but I think it was just dermatitis. 

My doctors don’t seem to take me seriously. I think they think I’m just anxious because of the extent of my health worries recently, and because of my age (25). 

I don’t have a family history of breast cancer that I know of - but should I advocate for more testing? Is this area even typical for breast cancer, I can’t seem to find that info."

Why are they so worried when I’m not, and my doctor doesn’t seem worried? I get that it’s scary, but I choose to trust the doctors.

On the lumpy side there is no pain, it's squishy feeling, but with my eyes closed it I can find it because it does feel different than the rest of the areola. I am now totally freaking out. 

I called my surgeon's office on Friday and they want me to call them on Monday and possibly come back in. 

Any (non-cancer) ideas that would cause this swelling/lump? My mass was so small that they could only see it when I had a ductogram, my mammogram was clear and the ultrasound just should a dilated duct. I was having nipple discharge, which was discovered when I saw a doctor for an ovarian cyst I have."

Chicagogogo,1573531660,"I’m a 31f In august I started having clear discharge from multiple ducts on my right breast. In October I began having bloody discharge from a single duct in my right breast as well as a lump I have never felt before.  The lump kind of feels like a small grape, I can easily pinch and move the lump. 
The first doctor I went to was very nice and answered all my questions and helped put me at ease. The breast specialist I saw next made me feel like I’m making all of this up and just want to go through these expensive appointments with no insurance, just for fun. 

I have my ultrasound and mammogram this week and I don’t know what to expect. I’m nervous it’ll hurt, I’m nervous they’ll find something, I’m nervous they won’t find anything and I’ll have worried and spent all this money for nothing.  The specialist just kept telling me “sometimes things happen and they just stop.” Which, I guess is reassuring, but also felt very condescending. 

I guess I say all that to say is what was your first experience like? Did the radiologist mention anything the day of or did you have to wait in limbo for 2 weeks before hearing anything?"

meoverthere,1573181407,"Wondering if there is anyone else here who has been diagnosed with IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer). 
I was diagnosed 05/14/19 just 2 days after my 49th b-day. I woke up little over 2 weeks earlier to a swollen breast and skin thickening. The symptoms appeared quickly, I had a procedure done on my back just a few days earlier and there were no symptoms at the time. I was one of the rare lucky ones who had an ER Dr who took my symptoms seriously and had a sister who had just lost her battle with breast cancer so he was much more aware of the risks and fortunately well aware of the signs of IBC so he demanded I see a surgeon the very next morning. Within 2 days I had a mammogram and ultrasound, within 4 days I was being seen by the head of the woman's center specializing in breast cancer, biopsies of both breasts were done a week later and then the diagnosis and by the first week of June I started chemo.

 I know how lucky I am, most women go months before diagnosed, sadly resulting in IBC mestastasizing. I am lucky that I was referred to the best cancer center in the area. I am lucky that despite how rare IBC is, my Drs have seen it before and knew how to treat it. I am lucky mine is ER/PR positive and HER2 negative (which is uncommon with IBC) and PET scan showed it was only limited to my breast with zero indication it had moved to my lymph nodes. I am lucky that despite a few rough spots I did good on chemo, with extreme fatigue and loss of tastebuds being my biggest hurdles. I am lucky according to the breast MRI I had done last week after my last chemo treatment it appears my body responded amazingly to chemo and shrunk the ""threads"" of cancer significantly, more than my oncologist or surgeon even expected it to. I am lucky my blood work has been so good and I am doing so well they are scheduling the radical mastectomy for 2 weeks from now. I know how damn lucky I am. But I am still terrified. This is IBC. I know the stats, I know what this aggressive, sneaky, horrible cancer can and will do. I know despite all my luck there is very little chance it won't come back in the next 2-3 yrs only next time in my lungs, brain, bones. I know despite how hard I am fighting or how amazing my doctors are,no sooner than I finally recover from all this and start enjoying life again,  I am going to be right back here going through it all over again. And I know eventually my luck will run out. 

With how rare IBC is there is no one around here who has gone through it themselves. Well I take that back, an acquaintance of ours lost his wife 2 yrs ago to it, she was one of the unlucky ones who went months with symptoms and by the time they diagnosed it, it was stage 4, in her brains, bones and liver, she didn't survive 6 months. We knew she had cancer but at the time not what kind, it wasn't until I was diagnosed the husband reached out to mine to offer support. I was suppose to be paired up with another IBC patient at the center (the only one they currently have) but after her mastectomy it was discovered she went from stage 3 to 4 and was stopping treatment. 

So many people, even those with breast cancer are unaware of IBC and the stats around it.  It's great news that 90% of breast cancers are survivable, amazing actually. But repeating that stat to me as encouragement means little when IBC's is so, so much lower and the chance of recurrance is so high. It's frustrating hearing again and again how their Aunt Mildrid had breast cancer 20 yrs ago, beat it and has been cancer free since. How wonderful for Mildrid and oh dear god I hope I beat the odds of IBC and can say the same but reality is so much darker and being told that again and again, no matter how well intended does not make my fear go away. 

I guess I am hoping there are other IBC survivors here. Someone who understands what I am dealing with, even better someone who has beaten the odds. Googling IBC is depressing as hell, 99% of the stories are about how they fought it only for it to come roaring back or worse, the endless, endless stories of those who didn't make it, no matter how hard they fought. Or the countless studies proving time and time again how miserable the survival rates are for this and how far behind in research medicine is in finding treatments that actually work. 

I know how lucky I am. I should count my blessings and stop dwelling on what I have no control over. But I also desperately need to talk to someone who is going through or been through what I am. That all this is worth it despite the odds."

Throwrasnappydoo,1573085142,"Had an appointment today to have a lump in my boob checked out by the dr. She felt it and measured it somehow with a cloth type measuring tape and said its pretty large and referred me for a mammogram and ultrasound and said they may biopsy it. I have never ever been to the doctor (parents didn't believe in doctors) before so it was kind of confusing and i think she was just explaining everything that might happen. 

I don't know if this is how a normal exam goes when you find a lump in your breast, i guess i was kind of just expecting her to say, oh, its just a cyst and send me on my way.

My main concern is that i am only 32. I have read that mammograms done on women under the age of 50 have a lot of false positive results and end up causing unnecessary biopsies and unnecessary treatments for non-invasive cancer that would never actually affect your health in a negative way. 

I do not want unnecessary treatment. I don't know if there is anyway to try and lessen the chance of false positives because i am so much younger than you are actually supposed to get a mammogram. 

If i got a second opinion about the lump would they just do the same thing and refer me for a mammogram etc? Or would they be able to do some different type of exam and tell me that it is just a cyst or something not serious?"

She told us that without radiation, her cancer can come back 20% but if does decide to do radiation, it will decrease to 6%.

I am kind of worried about her decision. I just want the best for her and I don’t want anything to happen to her. I was wondering if I can get some opinions and or past experiences. I think her biggest fear is her body becoming too weak from radiation.

I’m writing this on behalf of my mom (and me) as we struggle with the constant waiting regarding her breast cancer. 

In September, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I assume we caught it early but the tumor was around 1.9 cm in imaging studies, it was quite large and she just had a mastectomy last week. Her lymph nodes were spared and did not show cancer. 

Her initial biopsies said that she had HER2 negative and luminal b cancer. Her surgeon told her that she recommends hormone and radiation therapy. However, she is a surgeon and  today she told my mom that she has to refer her to an oncologist to decide the best treatment option. 

My mom really does not want to go through chemo and from what the surgeon told us, we thought it wouldn’t have been an option. Today, we’re confused and we’re back to waiting. 

I am incredibly anxious because I know my mom will struggle with chemo and it’s side effects and I just want her to be okay. 

Looking forward to reading your experience"

however for the past year the nipple has swollen and looks... super red irritated and i have discharge everyday some days it bleeds.

On October 7th I went for follow up Ultrasound &amp; cyst had ground a little and a new “lesion” appeared at 7:00 at a similar size (Oh &amp; they aren’t even calling any of them cysts anymore, just lesions???). October 14th I had appointment with breast oncologist, she ordered breast MRI, then proceeded to tell me about “how I am at a higher risk and that if MRI comes back abnormal we would treat it aggressively because my family history and I was already having issues... But if it comes but normal she would see me in 6 months for repeat scans (which I’m already scheduled for now).... I guess I am freaking out over what the aggressive treatment meant.... I was alone and didn’t think to ask. I also am just wondering if anyone else has been in this position. I know that there is prophylactic treatment, usually the hormonal therapy and even mastectomy... BUT here is the kicker.... I have an appointment on 29th with Gynocologic Oncologist because I had precancerous uterine (endometrial) polyps 6 plus months and (which is extremely rare in a premenopausal woman), new polls have appeared (guess that’s not good), I have PCOS, and bleed all of the time. All of these things are huge red flags for endometrial cancer/precancer.
Another thing that puts you at high risk for endometrial cancer is Tamoxifen, which is the hormone/chemo drug they give to women who are at a high risk BC... not sure how I could take that if I am already having these issues with precancerous polyps.... 
I’m just wondering if there is anyone out there that can give me some insight on any of this... I am having a ton of anxiety over this.

At this point what we know is that they think it is  1.1 cm, invasive lobular carcinoma, 90% estrogen, and 95% progesterone. HER 2 is not back yet and is Grade 2. Staging is not revealed yet but we have an appointment with the surgeon tomorrow and she may tell us hopefully only stage 1.
She has trouble breathing every night with the same symptoms and is terrified that there has been spreading to the lungs.  There are more tests and scans to be done but in the meantime the wait and anticipation is surreal.  She recently was prescribed diazepam and then Ativan to help sleep but it seems to only mask the problem. She has never used either of those or anything like that before but does seem to help.
The reality of her fear is breaking me. I know that there is that possibility of spread, but also try to remind her that it is still early and most likely not the case. Her primary told her that was a valid concern and she is right, but the honestly just intensified the worry.
We have not reached out to any family but our adult daughters and her sister. The only people who know are my supervisor and her supervisors. She is on leave and we are going to have some financial challenges with the loss of income but I do have plenty of sick time and my supervisor is very supportive of me taking the time to be with her for all appointments and treatment. We have insurance.
My challenge is that I want to listen to every word and concern in the best way I can, and support every tiny bit of everything she is going through.  She tends to worry about the worse and when the possibility of it being spread to her lungs comes up I have a very hard time keeping composure. I can’t let her see how upset I am and must stay strong for her. She can’t see me crying but I am truly freaked out and can’t bear to see how scared she is. 
If i could take the cancer away and put it in me I would do that in a heartbeat for 
my best friend and partner of 25 years.
Any helpful advise would be welcome.
Thank you for reading all this."
T_Mugen,1571464169,"So, one of my women in my family has breast cancer. Since it is growing like mad, she needs to go on hard core chemo. I don't get it too much, but, she was told she will immediately lose hair, become week and all that shit that goes with chemo.

My questions are:

a) someone told her she can't do chemo and weed oil at the same time. Why?

b) she's one great gal, we joke about the cancer and chemo to keep the positive energy up. Like, joking we will get her a dreadlocks wig so she can look like a real rasta when she smokes weed. :D We were talking about how everybody told her when will she lose her hair, but no one told her how long does hair need to grow back after the treatment. Do any of you know that?

It has been at the cutting edge of promoting awareness of breast cancer issues and has evolved along with the national dialogue on breast cancer. For women, October is an important time of the year to make appointments for mammograms.

As a part of NBCAM, National Mammography Day is observed annually on the third Friday in October. To remind all woman that the best defense is early detection, a mammogram can often detect a problem before there is any outward physical sign. In 2019, National Mammography Day will be celebrated on October 18.

Cancer was 22mm and had 3 lymph nodes affected. Recommendation was for chemotherapy then radiation. I have decided against both due to other illnesses. Has anyone else had similar and had the cancer spread or even not spread? My family are giving me a hard time and trying to make me feel guilty over not having any further treatment. Just feel so ill at the moment. Seeing oncologist tomorrow for follow up and bone scan results. I know there is no bone cancer but the scan has flagged something up.

Clairedeaire,1571196795,"I'm 35 and felt a lump recently. I immediately scheduled a breast exam at PP and she referred me out for a mammo and an ultrasound. The ultrasound came back with a tiny mass, about 8mm in size, that appeared to have all the indicators of cancer (undefined edges, blood flow). The ultrasound specialist told me ""I've been doing this long enough to know the difference."" Also she said that the mass was so tiny that the doctor was surprised she even saw it. Now I have a biopsy scheduled next week.

My questions:

1. How likely is it that the mass is actually 8mm?  I know it can hide and end up being bigger, so I'm wondering what others have experienced. I want to be prepared for the worst case scenario.

2. What usually happens after the biopsy? Do I go straight for a lumpectomy or will I need further tests?

3. I live in Florida and have no health insurance. Does anyone know what resources are available to me? I called Moffitt and they said they will help after I get my biopsy results, but I want to have a plan B and C in case it doesn't work out.

4. Has anyone waited a few months after their diagnosis in order to sign up for insurance? The open enrollment is next month, so I could sign up and have insurance by January 1st. However, I'm worried that waiting will make it worse.

I'm also just really scared right now. I'm full-time social work student who is juggling an internship and volunteering. My school program doesn't allow me time to work, so I'm living off my savings and student loans. Florida universities don't have to offer health insurance, so mine has no insurance options. I feel like the entire system is against me right now."

kenyeb29,1571074346,"As one of the most common types of cancer that people can unfortunately develop today, breast cancer has endangered millions of lives and taken countless more, cementing a reputation for itself as something that you never want to get. And although it commonly affects women, an increasing number of men are also starting to get diagnosed with it.

With that being said, however, a newly made research suggests that some breast cancer patients have a higher likelihood of surviving the ordeal, all thanks to a ‘special type’ of immune cell that’s actually found in their tumors.

fossilizedflower,1570474508,"Quick summary: 29 years old, Diagnosed in July with stage 1a high grade IDC in left breast, underwent unilateral left mastectomy August 28, 1.7cm tumor, clear margins and node negative, er/pr positive, Her2 negative, BRCA1 positive, Oncotype DX score 36

I've been feeling great since my mastectomy but the past week has been a flood of emotion. I had my first post-surgery meeting with my Oncologist last Monday. Everything so far had indicated low risk, but with my Oncotype result (score was 36) chemo is now being strongly recommended: 4 rounds of Taxotere and Carboplatin, followed by Tamoxifen. I will also be taking Lupron injections. 

I am wondering if anyone has had experience with this medication combination?

I can't find much information about these two meds used in combination. My Onc said the Carboplatin is recommended because of my BRCA mutation. I'm of course concerned about side effects, especially reading that Taxotere can cause permanent hair loss. I am hoping to be able to go through with cold cap therapy, if I can manage it financially.

I've asked about receiving weekly Taxol instead of Taxotere, as they have the same efficacy. The doctor is not opposed to Taxol if I would rather have that, but her concern with it is neuropathy and bone pain as a side effect, which apparently is much milder with Taxotere. 

I am feeling confused about what to do. I'm considering a second opinion but I know time is of the essence here. I'm also concerned that I've had headaches (at bed time, never had before) and constant dull lower right abdominal pain. Mentioned this to doctors but no scans have been ordered. Isn't PET scan common before beginning teatment?  

The decision to have a mastectomy with no reconstruction was much easier emotionally for me than facing chemo. I trust in my Oncologist but I can't shake the feeling that this might not be right for me, at least as a first line of treatment. Its hard to accept the potential damage to my body when I am otherwise quite healthy and feeling great.

I know no one can make this decision for me, but I'm hoping that hearing others' experience may help inform me further.

Any experience with Taxotere+Carboplatin or words of advice regarding chemo are appreciated! 

Also like to hear about complementary therapies that have helped others in managing side effects. 

Thanks for reading &lt;3"

-OrangeBlossom-,1570059103,"I am 32 years old. I have a significant family history of breast cancer (though none with onset earlier than about age 48-50). About 2 years ago, I found what felt like a sort of thickened area of tissue on my right breast. After a mammogram, an ultrasound and an MRI, the conclusion was that it was probably just an area of dense tissue, and I was told that I could just monitor it monthly and return if anything changed. Nothing ever did. The ""dense spot"" hasn't changed in size, shape or hardness; there's been no discharge, no change in skin texture or breast size, no visible dimpling, nothing.

Back around mid-August, I got scratched on the right hand by a stray cat, and about 10 days later I woke up with a massively swollen lymph node in my right armpit. It had appeared overnight and the skin was all red and inflamed around it. I also started having symptoms like fatigue, muscle pain and recurrent low fevers. I assumed this was just cat scratch fever, and the doctor seemed to agree. She prescribed antibiotics. Things seemed to get better for about a week or two, and then the symptoms returned with a vengeance.

This time, the doctor seems really concerned. She got me in for an ultrasound in two days to try to figure out what we're dealing with. I'm scared out of my mind because I suspect pretty strongly that this is probably breast cancer, and if it's in the lymph nodes like this, I know it's a lot more advanced than I'd like. I'm also beating myself up about the fact that this might have been addressed sooner, when it was more treatable. I keep wracking my brain for absolutely anything over the last two years that could have tipped me off, and I'm coming up with nothing, but I'm mad at myself anyway. And terrified beyond belief. I'm generally prone to anxiety and panic attacks and they've just been ramped up to a million.

Anyway, I'm sorry for dumping on y'all. I just needed a place to vent, since I'm waiting to tell most of my family/close friends until I have some definite answers to give them. I'm sorry for what everyone here is going through. It isn't fair. I wish you all joy and hope and strength in whatever circumstances you find yourselves."

baled  on me saying he needed a life. Surprisingly I was calm and didn’t trip him at a curb. Tho I’m not really into fish always have been told other fish in the sea. Radiation burnt me real good. Second degree burns and I hate sitting in the sun. Now I sleep a lot but not sure if that’s normal. Wasting time going on different sale and dating sites. So I posted pics of myself just before chemo as after are downright horror screamable. My hair was red and past shoulders pre “the lump”. It’s coming in grey, short n curly.

toothachee,1568934230,"Hi all, new to the community, new to this whole thing.
I’m 25 and just went through multiple ultrasounds, mammograms and a biopsy (my results came in today inconclusive so I’m going to be tested and monitored for the next year so fingers crossed)
However I have a question for anybody out there with the marker/clip
I was forced into mine even though I repeatedly said before and during I don’t consent to it (I have borderline and OCD and knew the marker would cause me great mental discomfort)
However it’s been a week since my biopsy and I have a weird, heavy pain in my chest and I’m positive it’s the maker. 
Has anybody else had issues with it?
My doctor is fighting me to not remove it but honestly I want to cut it out myself at this point.
Thanks in advance"
little-lu,1568735269,"Hi, so I was diagnosed with breast cancer on my left breast.  I was in my late 30’s.  No family history, no gene mutation.  It was 4 inches malignant HER +, grade 3, growth rate of 70%.  I thought I’d die...what a nightmare all of that and then the chemo.  Okay over 2 years cancer free now working on reconstruction.  My left breast got expander then permanent implant.  Now trying to line up my right breast.  Lift and reduction.  So I am three weeks out and now I have a breast infection on the breast that got the lift.  I was at the doctor today and my surgery site opened up and fluid gushed all over at the doctor’s office.  Has anyone had this happen?  I was super scared.  It kept gushing and I had to keep getting napkins and gauze, I changed them out like 4 times."

Nurse stated they dont think its an infection since her vitals do not indicate so but the oncologist thinks an infection may be possible. They have started her on antibiotics yet. She is not responding to any questions and can only muster a moan at best. Maybe a yes or no from time to time. Her white blood cell count is fine, but her red blood cell count is 7.2 (normally 10). The doctors think giving her blood could help but im not sure if its worth the risk of an allergic reaction. Shes not eating and isnt really able to take anything orally since shes so weak. Shes not even responding to close family members. Any advice?"

1. Did you buy something or use the bra provided by hospital?
2. What about it was easy to use?
3. What was difficult or annoying about it?
4. How did you deal with drains?
5. How did the bra make your underarm feel?"
jesscamm,1568672408,"Hi. I am wondering how you chose your oncologists and what resources you used to look them up and see if they are good.

We are interested in getting a second opinion which would be with another surgical oncologist. Would we have to get another second opinion from a medical oncologist too?

So far we have seen the surgical oncologist the most (he did the biopsy, ordered MRI ect). We have just met the medical oncologist who chose the chemo plan. 

It’s so much easier to just trust the doctor that was given to us but would you say it’s worth it to get the second opinion? The doctors we have now aren’t in a cancer center with a team approach. Or will treatment be similar regardless?

Diagnosis: Stage IIa, grade 3, ER+PR+ HER2- tumor is 4cm, no lymph node abnormalities seen in MRI

beesolynn,1568389972,"Introduction:
Hello lovely people, I'm a 27 year old married mom of identical 2 year old boys. I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and I am hopeful that this little community can help give me advice and answer some questions. 

Back story:
I found a lump on my breast on July 6, from there everything moved really fast. The following Monday I saw my PCP who sent me to get a ultrasound and mammogram that Wednesday. On the 15th I had two areas biopsied (both in the left breast) and by Thursday the 18th I was given a diagnosis. Two masses. Ductal Carcinoma in situ, stage 0, and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, stage 2. The following day I met with my medical oncologist for the first time. I love him. And we were told it is triple positive and he wanted to start treatment in the next 2 weeks. The following weeks was one appointment after another. MRI, CT, Bone scan, blood work, getting a port put in, meeting the surgical oncologist, the radiation oncologist and a million other people. I missed two weeks of work, where I don't have PTO and spent thousands on these tests and procedures. It has been stressful. Now my deductible and out of pocket is paid out, so at least I don't have to spend any extra the rest of the year. I have an ultrasound on Monday because after my first treatment the tumor shrunk but after the second treatment my breast became firm and tender. I hope it's nothing. Sorry if this is all over the place. I just was hoping to find a community that could give me some insight on what choice you guys made and if you regret any of it.

The issue:
Right now I'm struggling with what I want to do for reconstruction. I really don't want implants that can potentially cause issues down the road and need to be replaced. I like the idea of autologous reconstruction but there is a high risk of blood loss and I don't accept blood transfusions. I'm also at a loss for what I want in terms of nipple reconstruction. Be smooth and nude like Barbie? 3D tattoo? Full nipple reconstruction? What did you do and do you like it?"
rainbowpanda0234,1568272611,"Hi everybody,

I recently found a lump in my breast after having some serious pain there. At first I just thought it was bra related and starting a new job but after finding a rather large lump in my breast I got terrified and went to the doctors. 

He confirmed there was a lump there and my armpit nodes are swollen.  I have a mammogram soon and I’m so terrified. It’s been a week since I e started having serious pain and it’s starting to seriously stress me out to the point it’s hard to even leave bed. I keep missing work and I’m afraid I’ll get fired. 

My husband has been supportive and loving but I can’t help but feel incredibly guilty for stressing him out as well."
Aeithia,1568142208,"I've been told I have fibrocystic breast disease in the past, but I always have pain in my breasts(which seems to be common with fibrocystic breast disease) but I'm wondering if it's possible for me to get a mammogram because I'd rather be safe than sorry."
samanthaw513,1568089824,"Some background, I’m a 24 black/white (biracial) woman. I went through puberty a little wonky. I got everything at a normal age except breasts. I didn’t start getting breasts until about the end of 8th grade. However, despite being a competitive swimmer, I went from a C cup to a K cup in a little under a year with no explanation during my last year of high school into college. My breasts still periodically continue to grow. Anyways, recently I have been more tired, having night sweats, headaches, enlarged breasts, and cramps. I just thought my period was coming earlier. However, when changing out of my clothes tonight into PJs, I glanced and saw my left armpit was swollen/had a huge lump. The right one is normal and no lump. Given my odd history with my breasts (breast reduction set for Nov 15th), should I be concerned?"

mominapan,1567934989,"First and foremost I’m sorry to all of the women that have to undergo all of this.  I am a male and I am a significant supporter of all of you.  We received devastating news in our family for my older sister.  Another female with breast cancer. 
- Family history got our Grandmother in the 70’s,  Left breast removal unsure what kind of cancer she survived.  Killed Mom at 51 started in left breast 7 years on and off.  Aunt same side of family survived. 
- She was not positive for BRCA gene and very diligent on her mammograms since her20’s.
-  Detection came with a tiny lump in her left breast.  Minor inflammation viewable in scans for her lymph nodes unknown impact until surgery. 
- Long treatment ahead doxorubicin+chemo, wait four weeks, double mastectomy, weekly taxol, direct radiation and we wait.   There are several other things which I can’t recount.  

Why I’m posting this:
 - Hope there are survivors out there with positive stories.  HER2+ as I understand is pretty serious.  
- Ideas around nausea she’s been able to be prescribed a medicine and patch which helps but I think is making her very tired.  Open to alternative ideas like CBD etc?
-  Ideas I can give her about support?  We’re not a religious or positive affirmation type of family.  She’s keeping it very to herself not social media-ing her journey type."

I've had a bruised, tender pain in left breast for quite some time, just assumed it was related to my age and normal changes.  Day after screening I got a call back for this coming week.  They didn't tell.me much or maybe I didn't hear and retain what they said because I was shocked.  Anyway, 44 yo.  Periods becoming irregular in frequency, length and flow.  Pain is left breast, always feels like a bruise, tender to touch certain areas, sometimes feels like a hot needle shot through me.   I can't get past the tenderness, when I try to feel, but my husband says he feels ""something"" not normal in there.  I keep telling myself it's nothing, just a cyst, whatever, I don't believe myself.  Thoughts?  Help? Realities? Please...."
TheCatsMeow360,1567300904,"I am 29 I found a lump in my right breast, my nipple on the right is slightly darker, have a family history of breast cancer.  My Dr reffered me to get a mammogram/ultrasound and biopsy if needed. I didnt hear from the hospital in regards to a appointment. When I called they said they scheduled me for only the ultrasound....becuase of my age they wont do the mammogram. This seems a little messed up to me.... Also the refferal was sent in on July 30th, I called the hospital August 21st and my ultrasound appointment isn't until Sept 20th.... I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOTHING OR ELSE I AM GOING TO BE PISSED. 
Has anyone else felt like they were pushed around and not taken serious due to their age?"
perfechto,1567142245,"It’s nearly midnight and I’ve ended up here looking for what exactly I’m not certain. I found a hard lump on the underside of my left breast on Monday while breastfeeding my daughter in the wee hours of the morning. I called my clinic at 7am when they opened that day and was fortunate to be seen at 8am due to a cancellation. The NP confirmed it was concerning and referred me for an ultrasound which was this afternoon (Thursday). I arrived and the radiologist decided he wanted a mammogram first due to my age (32) but then decided on an ultrasound first because I’m breastfeeding. My bad feeling during the ultrasound was confirmed when the radiologist came in suggesting a mammogram as well as a biopsy which he wanted to squeeze into his schedule same day. I asked point blank if that’s because he was concerned and he said yes, that it was a nasty looking lump. Obviously we won’t know for sure until the results come back but he said based on his experience he’s assuming it’s likely cancer. I have no family history or really any risk factors. 

The only reassuring things I heard is that there doesn’t appear to be any other concerning areas per the mammogram, including my lymph nodes, and the lump is just shy of 2cm which he likes to see as those have better outcomes. He seemed to think if it was localized I should be in a good spot as far as treatment. 

Due to the Labor Day holiday on Monday I likely won’t find out until Tuesday or Wednesday next week. How do I make it until then? I’m taking the day off work tomorrow because I feel like I won’t be able to keep it together enough to interact with my coworkers or clients. I don’t even want to go back to work until I know. I don’t want to get the results while I’m at work. I’m trying to stay positive and focus on the fact there is still a chance it’s not cancer but it’s hard not to be consumed by thoughts of worst case scenarios. I last had a breast exam in March 2018 during the first trimester of my pregnancy so I’m not sure if it was missed then or developed after. I’m beating myself up for not doing self-exams more often. My daughter is only 11 months old and I lost my mom when I was 16 (not due to cancer). All I can say is this just sucks. I’ve known so many people that have gone through battling cancers of all types and I never thought it could happen to me. I’m sending love to all of you out there who are fighting and surviving. ❤️"
Delouest,1566993290,"I (31f) was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma 3 months ago after finding a 2cm mass in my right breast. After all the tests, it turns out I'm also BRCA2 positive. Progesterone and estrogen positive, HER2-. It has not spread to my lymph nodes. After a lot of thought, I had a bilateral mastectomy about 3 weeks ago. 

In all this time, the one consistent was that they thought chemo was very very unlikely. We caught it early, and I could either do lumpectomy plus radiation or a mastectomy. Either way I would be put on hormone blockers for 5-10 years. 

I was scheduled to meet with my oncology team after my surgery to go over the results and start meds, but that didn't happen. I got a call saying they decided to do an oncotype test to see if my cancer responds well to chemo and those results were not back yet.

But. They had said chemo was not a recommended when I first met with them so I'm confused?  

Is it possible something from the mastectomy labs came back and it was worse than they initially thought? Or because now they know I'm BRCA positive and want to treat it more aggressively if my tumor responds to chemo? 

If my oncotype results say chemo won't help, is that bad because it means they wanted to do chemo but it won't do anything? 

I don't have my new appointment until the 9th and now I'm a bundle of nerves and stress. Anyone else have this test done, and what did your doctors say about it? Is not recommending chemo a good or bad thing with this test? I want to hit my cancer with everything we can, but chemo also terrifies me. Any thoughts would be appreciated!"
pjm1127,1566932406,"I am an 18 year old woman and I am really nervous because I have inverted nipples as in if you look at my breasts from the side, the bottom part of my nipple is out while the top sinks in a little bit. I’ve always had somewhat inverted nipples but I’m just worried because it’s not fully inverted or fully outwards.. it’s sorta in a “s” shape. I also have milky discharge in one or both breasts.. not all the time though. Another thing is I have irregular periods and I am underweight/ not fully developed yet. Also sometimes I have a crawling sensation under my breast (sometimes it’s very itchy) and a kinda hard but NOT ROUND bump a little under my collarbone. I think that me being underweight for my height also contributes to having irregular periods but anyways.. what do you think? I’m thinking that it’s because I have not fully developed but some other people have told me that they might be symptoms of breast cancer. Thank you for anyone who answers this question!

Meowmeowmeowmeooow,1566873637,"Hi, I'm 25, 3 months ago I was initially diagnosed with high grade, er- pr- dcis, the tumor was extensive so we went ahead did a single mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. Final path showed a 2mm her2+ invasive tumor, after discussing with my oncologist, I have decided to not continue treatment with chemo and herceptin.

Today I had my second saline injection, 75ml, same as last week. However the pain has been unbearable even after I took muscle relaxers, even tried a Norco.
The spasm is so intense, I feel like someone is stabbing me with a knife.
At this point I don't know how to cope with it, I can't walk straight because it hurts way too much, evidently the pain is way worse than mastectomy.

I have a very active 13 months old with no help during the day since my fiancé has to go to work, I'm literally about to explode because of the pain.

Thanks for hearing me."
VelvetRabbit91,1566599297,"I was watching the nurse go over my breasts and on one she went over it multiple times before taking a couple of pictures. I didn’t see anything weird. Then she went over the other breast and immediately I saw a dark circle and she took many pictures of it and measured it. 
She said since I’m “young” (27) that they do ultrasounds first and mammograms if necessary. 
She went and showed the doctor the pictures she took and then came back and said I could get dressed and leave and wait for his phone call in a few days. 
I’m just so concerned and confused. Like, is not needing a mammogram a good thing or do they already know what it is and that’s why they didn’t need more testing? I just wanna know, tell me your honest opinion. I can handle the truth. 
My breast have no discoloration or rashes. Some places are tender or hurt if I press kinda hard but that’s it. 
I just wanna prepare myself for anything."

Since I forgot the last time I don’t know if I should wait again for my period, it’s supposed to come in 3 days and I already feel my boobs are getting a little sore because of my period coming (pretty sure those symptoms are normal, since it always happen when my period it’s about to start). I also doesn’t have an inward nipple or any dimples on my boobs, but I know those symptoms may never appear so...

skyfox9318,1565975495,"Hello all, let me give you a quick background and sorry for the wall of text:

I’ll be 26 next month (Female). I just had a physical a couple days ago and had my Dr look at a lump that is noticeable. She had felt this lump about 3 years ago and had ordered an ultrasound as a precaution. I was young and stupid and couldn’t afford it so I didn’t go. It’s a little bigger now. She ordered an ultrasound again and I also had some general blood tests because earlier this year my calcium was just the slightest bit over normal (I have since stopped my internet searches on all of this because it never ends well). I haven’t gotten the results back on that yet. 

I had my ultrasound today and they did find the lump and it was scary to see it on the monitor. The Radiologist says she thinks it’s Fibroadenoma, that it’s nicely rounded and smooth, but that there was no white line running through it which she said is very common but that she would have liked to have seen the white line. Because of this she recommended either a biopsy or wait 6 months and have another ultrasound. I opted for the biopsy which she obviously thought was the best decision. 

My biopsy is scheduled for the 28th and my follow up on the 5th. They said it’s not just the biopsy: they will be leaving a small titanium marker in there and then taking a mammogram to make sure it’s placed correctly—is this a normal procedure or one that I should take as a warning?? My mother had a biopsy within the last 5 years and I don’t believe they left a marker in. 

My question is what should I be on the lookout for during these appointments? Anything you recommend I ask about? If this ends up being something more than benign, what questions should I have ready to ask? Are second opinions necessary given our mostly advanced medical practices? 

My goal is to not think too much about this and stress myself out over what may be normal. I also start a new job this Monday (first job post college graduation). 

Thank you all for any answers you may have!"

FleetingFoxxx,1565553040,"I have stage 3 breast cancer and the lump on my breast was about the size of a large lemon.Its shrunk now.But Is stage 3 really that bad?Also Tomorrow I will start my taxol treatment,I will be doing it once a week until October 28.My doctor told me the possible side effects but I wanted to ask on here about other people’s experience with taxol.I have just come off another treatment and the hardest part for me was the nausea,but I never had any vomiting from it.Is vomiting a really common side effect of taxol,and how bad is the nausea?"
PiscesJoy,1565461368,"In March 2018 I was diagnosed with Stage 1 infiltrating ductal carcinoma at only 30 years old. I had a lumpectomy to remove the tumor and they removed a sentinel node to check for cancer cells and my nodes were clear. After my lumpectomy, I opted for a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I did not do radiation. I remember feeling some lumpiness that scared me on my affected breast post-reconstruction and my breast surgeon assured me it was just scar tissue. This morning while doing a routine self-exam I felt a small lump near my biopsy scar and it sent me into a tailspin of fear. I am praying this is not a local recurrence. Has anyone experienced anything like this where it did not turn out to be a recurring tumor? I found out there is something called fat necrosis which can feel a lot like a tumor and it occurs after trauma to the area. I'm hoping that this is all it is and that it's near where my original tumor was because there was more trauma on that side due to a biopsy, lumpectomy, and then mastectomy/reconstruction. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
anelegantclown,1565423708,"So, back towards the end of last year my mother was diagnosed with Stage 1A BC, 1.5cm tumor. 

She could not afford treatment at that time, and against all of of our advice decided to neuropath her way here. Well,she's had a follow up sonogram today and it's the exact same size. 

She credits this to juicing one organic lemon a day and cleaning up her diet.

KatyVav,1565392127,"Can anyone give me some feedback? I know I shouldn’t google things but that’s all I’ve done for the past 4 hours since my mammogram and ultrasound today and honestly, I am freaking out!!! 
Per my mammogram report I have extremely dense breast tissue. Multiple small scattered cysts and architectural distortion that is 7mm in size. I have a scheduled biopsy this coming Tuesday but my mind is all over the place. Anyone have  any experience with something similar? My BI-RAD rating is a 4. I have no family history with breast cancer that I know of and I’m 31 years old."
Bachvac,1565371835,"Hi.. To start off with a bit of family history.. 
My grandma had breast cancer when she was in her 40s. She found out when she noticed her skin was different in that area, sort of like a pin is holding it in. She had her breast removed and is now almost 80 and in perfect health.

My mom is now 59. 
She has had yearly check-ups since she was around 35-40yo.
She had a benign tumour in her left breast and had it removed 10 years ago. 
5 years ago another benign tumour formed in the same place. Doctor said it's nothing serious. She continued the yearly check-ups and nothing changed until this year.

The screen showed the tumour has grown twice in size. He felt her lymph nodes and said it's probably still benign and that her lypmph nodes feel okay, but since it grew they will be taking it out.

She went to get a biopsy done and the doctor doing it saw a small tumour right next to that one. She of course took samples from both. The other one that the doctor missed is ""shaped tubular"" and they noticed some microcalcification.

Today we found out that it isn't benign and more details are coming on tuesday (type, treatment etc.)
I'm as worried as I can be.. 

Please, if anyone has seen/experienced something similar to this share your experience..
I really want to gather as much information as soon as I can so that we can MAKE SURE that the treatment is effective.
I don't want there to be any room for medical mistakes.  We lost grandpa to kidney cancer and it makes me sick thinking how careless the doctors actually were.

Recommend any additional tests, foods that will help, things to look in doctors reports.. absolutely anything..

Thank you so much in advance and I hope that you and your loved ones stay healthy or will get better."

Cablesixback,1565103895,"Arrrggg!!!!  I’m 15 months post chemo and am still having chemo related side effects!!!  I hate it!
My nose runs constantly, yeah for two allergy pills every day to dry that up. And the two pills cause me to be super dry so I over hydrate so have to take salts and another pill!!!

Then my eye sight crashed. I have posterior subcapsular  cataracts!  Yeah! Losing my vision! Can’t read unless my glasses are off and my tablet is on HUGE letters. New glasses!  And the fix is new glasses until my glasses can’t fix it and then surgery.  (Glad that I was tipped off to get an eye exam every 5.5 months because my insurance will pay for new lenses if I go back and have a RX change in less than 6 months).  

And I hurt!!!  I hurt before cancer then the damn chemo and all the pills and shots and hormones to keep this at bay makes me feel so old. I’m always tired and hate it. I’m on more pills for that. 

And I was sent to counseling for my diagnosis. That’s fine. I know I need counseling and a safe place. Well the doctor I was sent to is not a safe place. In fact it’s a horrid place. And now it’s looped with my pain management so when I fire my doctor next week I’m firing my entire pain management team. Love this crap. 

I feel like I’m on a stupid hamster wheel and can’t get off. Just going around and around and around waiting for the next problem to crop up. And since I won’t have pain management until I can get someone, anyone to help it’s just going to suck now. 

Off to my wonderful lymphodema therapist because they took out 35 lymph nodes for my surgery and I’m puffy..."

whyisthecarpetwet,1564508926,"I found a lump. Waited for my period to end and it’s still there. So I made an appt with my gyno. It’s not until the 12th of August. 

My grandmother had both her breasts removed. I don’t know why. She has passed and my mother has neurological issues and doesn’t remember. 

I know it’s usually not cancer and that’s what I hoping, obviously. I know you guys aren’t doctors, but I’m wondering if you wouldn’t mind giving me your thoughts so I can prepare mentally either way. 

I noticed it about 2 weeks ago. It’s hard to figure out the size and shape. I can’t quite tell. My best guess would be grape sized, but I can’t tell the shape. It seems to be attached to my chest wall, not really in the boob tissue if that makes sense. It’s tender, I don’t know if that’s because I’m always squeezing it or if it’s tender on it’s own. I have no other breasts changes. No inverted nipple or dimpling or anything like that. Ive got nothing but soft tissue in the other breast. I can’t tell whether it’s hard or not. It’s sort of in the middle, behind the nipple and there is breast tissue all around. 

I’m one of those prepare for the worst and hope for the best types. What do you guys think?"
mmd0919,1564458272,"Hello everyone!

My mom recently had her mastectomy after being diagnosed with Stage 1 Breast Cancer (HER2). 

At first she was finally calm and taking everything one day at a time when her pathology came back negative for cancer. But because the size of the cancerous cell were a certain size, it was finally diagnosed to be Stage 2. The doctors are recommending for her to do chemo for prevention. She will be taking the following:

Pertuzumab
Trastuzumab
Carboplatin
Docetaxel 

Right now, her fears are coming up again. The Latinx community has a lot of misconceptions and fears about cancer because of lack of resources and education. She gets more afraid especially because when speaking with doctors there is a language barrier.

From talking to her, her worst fear is that cancer will come back. She started doing research about the chemo, and it makes her afraid that while reading things like “gives 5 years of chance of survival” come up. 

Can y’all let me know what y’alls experiences were like and what to expect?"
beef_gurl,1564385866,"I was diagnosed with DCIS after finding a small lump about 2.5 months ago. I had small breasts, and touched them a lot, so when I found a lump, I knew it wasn't there before. Most of the women on my mother's side have had breast cancer, and last year my mother had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. 

I was repeatedly told not to worry, and so I did not. A week after my biopsy, I received the call that they had found cancer cells. It was DCIS, non-invasive. They call it stage 0, or pre-cancer. 

For various reasons, I opted for a bilateral mastectomy. I'm 29, hormone treatment is not an option for me, and it runs in the family. 

I'm 5 weeks post op, and did not have to undergo any radiation or chemo. My surgery went incredibly well, all of my pathologies came back negative, including the three lymph nodes they took from under my arm. This is all amazing news, and I'm very grateful that I did not have to go through further treatment. 

Yet, I can't shake these feelings of ""not bad enough."" That because it wasn't advanced, and I caught it early, I'm not really a survivor, that I'm a drama queen, and making a big deal out of something that really isn't. 

I'm currently undergoing saline injections into tissue expanders to prepare for reconstruction, and am still not fully healed from the mastectomy. I will also be following up with my oncologist indefinitely. These all seem like reasons that I AM a survivor, but imposter syndrome seeps in, and I downplay the emotional toll all of this has taken. I don't think I've fully processed everything; everything happened so fast."

kwd0288,1564145863,"My Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer over three years ago. She was diagnosed with Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. She had a double mastectomy with reconstruction &amp; chemo. A year ago she coughed up blood and went to the doctor. Turns out, she had pneumonia. They took CT scans of her lungs and saw one small nodule and said it was probably scar tissue but would do scans again in a year. Monday of this week she had her follow up CT scans and they found 15+ nodules on her lungs ranging in size from 5-9mm. It’s been the hardest, most emotional week for my family and me. This morning my Mom is having a lung biopsy and next Thursday she is having a PET scan. Her pulmonologist said that the nodules present themselves more like cancer, but that’s just an assumption based upon the scans. Her breast cancer hasn’t always been clear to me as it relates to being triple negative... initially we were told her cancer was not triple negative but the cancer cells present/act as if it’s triple negative. So confusing. 

Anyways, have you known of other women with this kind of ‘scare’? Having scans show something in other areas? I’m just wanting to understand what others have been through or know from experience."
ldewji,1564116674,"My mom was diagnosed with papillary carcinoma at the beginning of this year. She had a mastectomy and a diep flap reconstruction in May. Just last week She was referred to Tom Baker Cancer Centre and met with an oncologist. 

She was told She had stage 2 cancer and that due to the size (33mm) and grade (3), they strongly recommend chemotherapy. Invasive ductal carcinoma. The deep margin is also positive - and the surgeon cannot take out any more as it would be muscle. An oncotype dx test has been done and we get results next week. She does not want to do chemo but it seems that is the only option the oncologists gave her. I’m very scared for her as I know chemo has it’s positives and negatives. We are looking for alternative options other than chemo if we can do this instead to increase her survival rate."
Charyion,1564052133,"I'm a radiation oncologist, so I obviously get many questions about all aspects of cancer. I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. As one of the most common and best studied cancers, this includes breast cancer. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

Correl_Nocte,1563913127,"First of all, I want it to be known that I am a 19 year old male, who is possibly very over anxious about what I've found and what it may be. I know that there's very few men who get this at a young age, but I'm scared I may be added to that number.

Saturday night I started getting this itching burning pain from my right breast, along with some tenderness and redness. Upon inspection i noticed a fingertip sized lump a little under and below my nipple. My mind immediately went to breast cancer, which made it hard for me to sleep that night.

The next day I took some ibuprofen to ease the pain and put some Bengay on the spot, thinking maybe it was some sort of muscle knot. This went on until today, where the size of the lump has shrunk a little and the tenderness/redness has gone away, but it is still painful to touch.

However, as of last night my lymph node under my right armpit has swollen and also hurts. Not too much, but enough to be annoying. I figured it was because I am a little sick as of Sunday, but I told my mother about the lymph node ( not about the lump in my breast) and she said if it doesn't go away by the end of this week we are going to the doctor. Even if it does, Im still planning on going if this lump remains.

I guess this all sums up the context of my situation, and I just needed people to talk to about it. I've been spending hours reading about breast cancer and its process and survival rates and Im just way too anxious for my own health. I have no guarantee this is what it is of course, but everything seems to be lining up for it to be so. I'm just really scared and needed to open up to something and get it off my chest."

My mom suggested that I Marie Kondo my breasts, thank them for nourishing my children, and get rid of both of them. I'm not there yet. 

I'm all over the place right now. Today I'm pissed. Yesterday was shell shock. It's tiny in the great scheme of things, but I just finished healing awesome nipple piercings and my husband bought me beautiful jewelry to wear in them. Can I possibly get reconstructed nipples pierced? Do I want to?

Ellaaura,1563506170,"Hello! I am a young adult female who, upon recent inspection, has noticed several concerning things about my breasts.

1. There is a large (similar to the circumference of a golf ball or walnut,) bumpy, purple and green bruise on my left breast. This bruise seems to get larger daily, but is not accompanied by any pain.
2. My right breast, while it has always been slightly larger than the other, has become significantly larger, to the point where I am only comfortable in sports bras anymore.

To clarify, there is no chance the bruise could be a hickey, and the increased size of my breast is not related to my menstrual cycle. 

Also, and I do not know if this could be related, (TMI warning) but I have also discovered a pea-sized lump on my cervix, but that lump is not accompanied by pain or bleeding as it would with cervical cancer.

Should I be concerned? Or wait it out until going to see a doctor?"
Expatmommy79,1563503270,"I went for my annual physical last year and dr felt a lump on my left breast. I felt the same thing a few weeks previously and she also confirmed it felt suspicious.

She sent me the next day for a mammogram and ultrasound. The ultrasound tech called in the radiologist and she showed me the mass and why it looked concerning.

She sent a requisition for biopsy. Told me it would take 7-10 days to get results after the biopsy.

I got an appointment for a biopsy 4 days later for the lump on my breast as well as the underarm.

The biopsy was done on a Monday and the radiologist told me results would be in 3-5 business days.

I was near my Dr office today so I popped in and asked the receptionist if my results were in. She said yes and that my Dr reviewed them but didn’t leave her any instructions. Dr wasn’t in at the time.

She then told me to come in a few hours later to see my Dr.

Then she called me back to tell me only 1 report was in and that the 2nd wasn’t ready yet so it wasn’t worth coming in and I should wait for the second one. They would call me.

I’m now freaked out. Either the first was negative and the second one needs more testing. Or the first was positive and they are now busy classifying it?

calamity_basket,1563362972,"I am going in for full right breast, external cone radiation therapy. 16 days full breast, four days boost. My lymph nodes were clean, surgeons says I don’t need radiation on them. Only took two, no weakness, loss of motion, no lymphedema. Recovery from surgery took weeks longer than expected. Have numerous allergies. 

My radiation oncologist is impatient and dismissive of questions. I am small (5’3”) and very pale with freckles. I sunburn extremely easily. I spent almost seven years on steroids for adrenal failure in the past and have skin thinning from it, I’ve also been on antibiotics in the last six months that make you sun sensitive. I am worried about how bad it will be on my skin. 

Also, I did my dry run yesterday and they marked where the treatment area, where the radiation will be. It is my entire right side, from sternum, to below my rib cage, around my side, including my lymph nodes. The person doing the radiation treatment couldn’t say whether my lymph nodes would be spared. 

Anyone have right breast radiation? Was it all over your chest, spleen to collarbone, did it damage your ribs and lungs? Did it burn the skin of your whole chest? Did it damage your lymph nodes? They’re being cagey. Not looking me in the eye. They keep saying ask the doctor, but the doctor won’t talk to me. 

I got delayed, first by the surgery, then by medical oncologist (scheduling issue). I can’t just stop and see someone else at this point. I am at day 63 after surgery. 

What is the experience like? What should I expect in terms of being burned and fatigue? Any other side effects to expect? How long after treatment is over does fatigue last? I will have to start tamoxifen two weeks after radiation. Will I simply go from radiation fatigue to tamoxifen fatigue and never stop?

Any advice would help. Thanks in advance."
theashjohnston,1563333904,"I just turned 18 and I noticed a lump on the side of my right breast about 2 months ago. Family history of fibrocystic and dense tissue. After seeing the obgyn, she assured me it looked benign and was likely a fibroadenoma. She gave me an order for an ultrasound but I put off the ultrasound (because she’s nearly positive it’s benign so why would i worry) and just got it a couple days ago. After the ultrasound, they said they need to biopsy it to be sure. I am phobic of medical procedures so this really freaks me out. Even more than that, I’m worried they have to biopsy it because it looks abnormal? It was about 6cm. If anyone has had a core biopsy before did it hurt? do you have a scar? I’m terrified of it honestly."
Esjayde,1563157458,How long does it last or is it permanent? I've heard it can last 6 months to 2 years or longer. Is there anything that can help it?
abesheet,1563126982,"Yeah. It is early stage. ""Non invasive"". ""Treatable"". ""Hasn't spread to the lymph nodes yet"".

Still, they want to remove my breast. That, apparently, is the ""treatment"" for all stages of breast cancer. Remove the breast. Hit you with radio therapy. Hormone therapy. Wait a few years, and remove the other breasts.

And remember: the cancer may still return.

lasheen__,1563043387,"Hey,,  So my mother was diagnosed with STAGE 4 breast cancer in 2015, back then the PET scan showed metastasis to bones specifically speaking; in the skull, the backbone, the ribs, and the knees.   
 3 years of therapy and treatment got her sick of treatment, she decided that cutting off treatment is the solution and she  cut off any hopes for us to make her back off her choice.  
So, about two weeks ago, She was hospitilized as her condition worsened; she was vomitting all day long and her stomach was in shape of a pregnant woman's..  
days later the results came back and ultrasonic showed tumors on liver; the breast cancer metastasized to liver and caused ascites which accumulated a 10 litre inside.  


I'm currently feeling like shit, I dont have no sign of hope and I really dont know what to expect.  
I can accept the fact that she won't be here for long, that her case isn't curable and the treatment doesn't do anything but prolong her life a bit.

Bootsandcatsyeah,1562609956,I hope she isn't making a big mistake in doing so. She is 73 and read online that chemo isn't very effective or advantageous for women her age. I believe everything she's read has come from one article and I'm not sure if that info is dated or not. I've tried to do some research on it myself but haven't really found anything conclusive. She had cancer 40 years ago and I know her unwillingness likely stems from how harsh the chemo was on her back then. For background info she has stage 1 BC and has already had a successful surgery. Is this a death sentence for my Nana or is she doing the right thing? Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!

HangryAbiii,1561994628,"Hi, 

Just this weekend whilst I was taking a shower I noticed a lump on the side of my left Breast. I had a look at it an it was a reddish lump. I never told anyone, as I hoped it would go away and it was just from an injury.

The next day I woke up again with the worst feeling ever so I had a look in the mirror, my mother came in and saw what I was doing so she had a look and she had the most scariest reaction ever and told me we have to go and see a doctor.

I’m very scared this might be cancer! I don’t want to die. I’ve been search all across the web searching for symptoms all night and all say, thinking about it also made my stomach ache for a few hours.

I don’t know what to do... help? 😕"
abeseet,1561815431,"It's been three days since I had mine done. And I have yet to feel a pain. True. There was a lot of Lidocane used for the procedure. And I had mine done at Virginia Mason Breast Clinic - where the Radiologists and her assistant are the kindness most supportive people in the planet. And I have been very careful to follow all that I was told \[wore the bandage to bed the first night; wore supportive bra all day and night for the next - without showering or exploring my wound; and, of course, not lifting even a cup of coffee with my right arm - the lump+calcification is in my right breast and hasn't spread to the lymph-nodes yet\].

However, I am surprised by the amount of pain I anticipated, and by the amount I got. The only time I even felt a little needly prick sensation in the last three days is when I was sitting at the back of the bus and the tires seem to be jumping up and down yesterday morning \[the day after the procedure\]. I didn't feel much even after a fit of coughing seized me, that I was sure would push the 'markers' out and make me bleed for hours.

I know the idea of hearing a gun-cocking sound on top of your breast, and the knowledge that they are taking a part of you is very frightening. It made me break out in cold sweats, and turn my brain into mush, during the procedure \[despite closing my eyes not to look at the ultra-sound; and despite one of the nurses massaging my arm all along to distract me from what was happening\]. Facing your own mortality, even for someone who has considered death a safe heaven from all of life's problems, wasn't an easy feat. However, a have come across a paper-cut that hurt more than a breast biopsy. You will be ok. Good luck. And God bless."

mjr05004,1561555859,"Hi all. 

My big sister got diagnosed with breast cancer about a month ago. She had a mastectomy and they removed 21 lymph nodes.  She woke up with be biggest smile on her face from surgery. She was in high spirits recovering about a week and a half after surgery. She has been so anxious about possible chemo and radiation. We just got pathology results from the biopsies of the lymph nodes and they found 4 were cancerous. She is young and I know she is strong and will fight this. But it’s all mentally a lot for her. 

Docs also advised her she will not be able to have children naturally so she’s also undergoing fertility treatments so she might one day be able to have kids. Going through all this I feel she gets depressed sometimes and I want to help her manage her emotions because I feel this will be so important for the uphill battle. She has a huge support network behind her. I am managing a lot of the doctors and appointments and paperwork with insurance for her. I live about 5 hours away but have thankfully been able to take time off to be with her so she’s never alone. She was getting ready to relocate with her husband to a new city and now with chemo that will have to be on hold. From what we have been told chemo could take months and it’ll be harder for us to take time off to be with her but someone will always be. As she is getting ready for chemo and radiation what are some things I can do to help her? 

I feel her anxiety calm down by just physically being there but when I can’t be what can I do? 

I am a scientist and the first thing I want to do is get informed and understand the best treatment options for her. But I feel mentally I am so unprepared to help her. 

Any advice would be helpful specially from those who have been through the hard journey.

Hoping for a great day for everybody."
Abhiraj_digi,1561526214,"It was hard to find out that [my friend's mother is diagnosed with cancer](https://medium.com/@sreerajn309/cancer-in-my-experience-when-my-besties-mom-was-diagnosed-with-cancer-1bdf66597396). She was very kind and caring to all of us. After diagnosed with cancer, my friend and his family went through a lot of hardship. The treatment cost was a hard thing to manage. But the hardest thing was watching the side effects on her. I think that is why cancer is considered one of the deadliest disease in the world. Even after you are cured or treated the effects of the disease leaves a mark of its own.

Cancer does not only affects one's body. It also shatters the patients and the families mental state. There is nothing worse than that. To overcome this, everyone has to stand together and face it."
seeUsooon,1561525862,"Hi everyone, I posted something similar on r/advice, but I figured this sub would be more personal.


So, I work at my moms office and she wasn’t in today so I printed out some documents and set them on her desk. I noticed a stack of my siblings mail so I decided to see if there was anything for me since I had heard my mom mention that my dr referral might be at the office. I didn’t see anything for me, but I saw she had a dr referral and the envelope was already opened. So, I looked. I am always respectful of peoples privacy, and I understand that it wasn’t meant for my eyes, but thats my mom and I worry n I love her and I had a weird feeling to check since I had a really bad dream that something tragic happened to her. The referral was for a mammogram that said “diagnosis: mallum malig neoplasm breast” or something like that, I can’t remember the exact wording. I did some research and ya, breast cancer. My parents are the type to keep things secretive from my siblings and I because they never, ever want us to worry. It doesn’t feel real because she hasn’t told us, but that information is in my head and I don’t know what to do with it. I don’t want to expose her since she has the right to tell us when she wants, and I want that right to be kept hers, but I don’t know how to go by everyday keeping this in my head. I think its even worse not knowing the severity of it and not being able to ask. I also have 3 other siblings, 30f, 28f, and 22m and its going to be hard keeping it from them as well. I’m 19f and I’m such a momma’s girl this is breaking my heart. Any advice on how to go forward in this situation would help.

I felt a lump on my breast (nothing scary since I’m always getting friboadenomas) went to the doctor just to check and get piece of mind. She sends me for an ultrasound and they discovered I have a few fibroadenoma plus one that is not and they think it might be cancer. I’m scheduled for a biopsy on Wednesday. 
I went to ask for the time off from work, mind you I already ask for time off last week for the ultrasound, and for next Monday for another appt. my boss then tells me if this is going to be a constant thing which I say that I don’t know since it all depends on the results I get from the app. She wants to know what is the worst case. She is being really rude and then when I tell her I might have cancer and I would have to get treatment she said we will talk later. 
I guess I needed to vent since I’m already nervous about the biopsy now I also have to worry about my job."
whenbreastsattack,1560550930,"As I am sure many of these stories start, it was just a lump. Found about two months ago, then a routine dr. appointment, then a routine mammogram, then some routine-don’t-worry-most-things-come-back-benign biopsies, and then a heart breaking phone call. 

We are told out of two tumors biopsied, one is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, and the other is DCIS. They did see other “suspicious” things on imaging but did not biopsy, and will be handled by future surgery. 

Biopsy was two days ago so as of now no more specific information other than “she has breast cancer”. 

The waiting is excruciating. She has had very swollen lymph nodes under her armpit recently. She has had lower stomach discomfort that doesn’t seem to be food related that comes and goes recently. And a mild cough/cold that seems to have gone away. But with every thought, every unoccupied minute her mind turns to “it has spread everywhere”. 

She has mostly shut down. Not eating, not sleeping. We got her a prescription today for anxiety and to help her sleep. Seems to be doing the trick so far. But she is unconsolable most of the time. And I know I can be strong enough for the both of us, but I just want to know what is wrong now, what we need to do to tackle it, and just start fixing it. She is the love of my life and a wonderful human being, but she is not a warrior. That was suppose to be my job in this relationship. I am here to fight any battles that might arise. But this enemy is coming from within and I fee like I have my hands tied behind my back.

coppermelon,1559077564,"Hi. I found a lump a couple of weeks ago. I’m 31. My doctor referred me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I went today. The radiologist looked at the images and they could see the lump on the imaging, but “couldn't tell what it was”. At least that's what they said. The radiologist did not speak with me, they just sent a nurse to take me to another room and call to get the first available appointment with the breast surgeon Monday morning. She's going to do an ultrasound herself and probably a biopsy during the ultrasound. I'm scared. I would think a normal cyst would be easy to tell on mammogram and ultrasound.

I know just seeing the doctor is the right next step, but I feel like there's something else I should be doing. I just don't know what. So I'm posting here. Hi, everyone."
chloeant,1558916455,"(Little background about me: 21 years old breast cancer and ovarian cancer runs on both sides of my mother's side of the family) I have been on many forums and websites and reading about women who go and get there breast ultrasound done and they hear that there lump is non-cancerous or cancerous. I have terrible anxiety and was wondering if anyone has encountered the situation I am about mention.  So as soon as I found the lump i went to the Dr.'s she scheduled me a ultrasound appointment while the tech was doing my appointment she said that she thinks Ill be fine due to my age and yada yada. I get the results about a day later over the pone and the person told me that the Dr. says ""it appears to look fine"". Pause. Appears? that sent me into an anxiety fit like no other. Did not even tell me WHAT it was. and that was that, so i called back and asked if the dr could tell me what exactly it is because this serious condition runs in my family. She tells me that that she will give me a call back after the Dr clarifies it.1 day goes by, 2 days go by, 3 days go by, shit. a WEEK goes by and nothing, i wrote it off as okay.. maybe im just tripping? I get a call Monday morning and the scheduler says that the Dr. wants to bring me in to discuss my ultrasound results. I asked well, i was told it appears fine so why the switch? she then told me she pretty much cant say anything and they scheduled me as soon as they could (Really busy office). I have two weeks till that appointment and i have been in my head so much. By the way my symptoms are chest pain in my left breast (where the lump is located) other than that i have no other signs except the lump and breast pains. I do feel like my body is changing though, but then again it could be all in my head. Basically. what do you guys think? Am i tripping? Anyone experience this weird call back switcharoo thing? Thank you all in advance."
Jaylee143,1558899313,"Hello, I have been having a very hard time with my oncologist. They suck, they don’t help me with anything. 
My  big toenails are infected with some kind of fungus, it’s pushing my toenail off. It hurts! He hasn’t helped. 
My mouth sore are SO bad I didn’t eat for an entire week. No help, I had to go to the fucking clinic to get the magic mouthwash. 
They are finally starting to go away and yest I ate a solid meal for the first time in about a week.  I’ve been having really bad anger episodes. Has anyone else been having those? I get so angry and upset (typically when I haven’t eaten in a while) and start eating and raving about almost nothing and making less sense than normal.
I really don’t want to be this person. 
Physically the mouth sores and toenails are the worst part for me so far. I’ve been through worse, unfortunately, and I’m just very thankful it’s almost over. I wish it was already... if you have any suggestions I’d appreciate it. 
I used everything I was told to prevent the mouth sores and I really want to try to prevent them for the last chemo. 
I used warm water w/ salt &amp; baking soda, I used biotene rinse, toothpaste AND lozenges, I used the magic mouthwash when I got the sores. I used the lidocaine. I tried oil pulling and it makes me puke. 
Idk what else to do!! I shrunk so much already I can’t lose that much more weight. I lost all the extra weight I had already. 
I’m not looking forward my double mastectomy either but I feel like this is worse torture for me bc at least I can eat and maybe have some visitors during surgeries.. idk. I’m only 31 and I’m just having a lot of trouble  finding reasons to even do this... 
I mean what’s the point? If your life was good before cancers then of course fight! but my life has always been &amp; (if the past is any indication of the future) will always be shitty.

I was concerned because my understand is that Tamoxifen is supposed to be taken long term to reduce the recurrence.

metastatic_mindy,1557690383,"Wanna know what it is like being a mom with terminal cancer? 

It is worry and fear. Anxiety and a constant psychological pain. It is living with the realization that you are going to single handedly tear your children's world apart. It is such a feeling of despair and loss.

It is knowing that there isn't a damn thing you can do to ease their pain when you die and it is scary as fuck because you HAVE to trust that others will make the best decisions possible for your children's futures and you have absolutely no say in it.

It is heart breaking and dark. It makes you feel inadequate as a mother because you are not 100% anymore most days I am lucky to be running at 50%. It is telling your kids ""I can't do this right now I don't feel well"".

It is your children watching you turn into someone they don't know anymore. It is them turning to others for comfort or help because they know you are just to tired or sick or mentally not able to. 

I love my children but I absolutely hate what this disease is doing to me.

I hate that it made me question why I ever had children, after all I am going to cause them a world of hurt and pain. What was the point? Why was I even born into this world? Why was I allowed to ever have children, if all I am going to do is die when they still need me?

I do my best to push past the torment tI feel every single day. I make a conscious choice to be as present as possible for them. I try to make every single moment matter. But in the end will it balance out the pain they will ultimately feel?

OtterBurrow,1557589554,"Hi all, posting this to see if anyone else experienced depression on Anastrazole/Arimidex, and letting you know if you do, you are not alone.

I recently stopped taking Anastrazole due to debilitating depression. I was taking it for six weeks with no side effects, when I started getting emotionally fragile. I'm no stranger to low self esteem and social anxiety, but I reached new levels of self loathing, and found myself weeping over small disappointments. I socially isolated so as not to inflict my repugnant personality on friends and strangers. Things improved slowly ten weeks in, after I stopped taking it for two weeks. Other than the depression, I had no other side effects. The AI did its job; the tumor's Ki-67 protein level went from 20-25% to 10%, and I'm having surgery in six weeks.

Now my oncologist has me on Exemestane, which I've been taking for two days. I'm hoping this will get me back into the world.

It's only about one droplet each time, but it is definitely coming from my nipple. It expresses like milk, but it's blood.My right breast is also more sensitive and painful than my left breast when I press into it. It also seems firmer than the other one. It's gotten more warm and painful as the night has gone on and it's woken me up a few times from tenderness and pain.

I am going to a walk in doctor tomorrow to check it out. I strongly suspect there's an infection  component, but the bloody discharge is freaking me out.

WHERE_IS_MY_DAUGHTER,1556576913,"Hi,

I'm a little horrified. I (20f) found a lump on my left breast close to the bottom near my armpit close to a month ago. It feels like a marble but it's tender at times. I had an ultrasound today, and as I watched the screen it turned red and yellow. It seemed pretty even but there was another black area next to the main area on the screen. The doctor came in and said I have a small lesion, and there's actually two lumps (a small one is hiding right next to the main one). Then he said I need to get a biopsy done to rule anything out and I might need a mammogram after that too. I'm really worried. The color worried me, the doctor coming in worried me more, and getting a biopsy scheduled made me horrified. 

Is it going to be cancer?"

How can I make it clear to my gynecologist that I am still afraid and worried about it? or do I go crazy for nothing, or do I go crazy for nothing, because the ultrasound has revealed nothing?

Well last night was my exchange for a unilateral mastectomy and things went a little wonky. I had silicone implants with fat grafting from my abdominal area and the surgeon said it was a fantastic outcome. Unfortunately I was last on his docket and started bleeding internally in the non-cancer boob soon after. Had to have a second emergency surgery at about midnight (and he had to come back from an hour away!). Pain is not horrible but definitely more challenging than the mastectomy. I was told the abdominal area where they got the fat will be pretty painful soon but so far it’s ok, just boob pain but I sense that’s because the nurses have been slow to give me the meds. I’m still positive and hopeful that the pain will go away relatively quickly and my boobs will looks awesome! And I’m so freaking glad the expander is out!"

Did you know that pectin can be more than just a source of fiber? This is where Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) comes in. You see, the pectin our moms and grandma used to thicken jams mostly came from strawberries, apples, oranges, lemons, and zest. This pectin when heated with sugar acted as a thickening agent for jellies as well.

According to scientists, our intestines are incapable of absorbing natural pectin that is why it is digested to provide fiber. Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) is obtained from carefully selected citrus fruits. It is processed through temperature and pH regulation to give differences in pectin molecule sizes, structure, and weight. In case you come across a Modified Citrus Pectin product, it will definitely be in liquid, capsule or in powdered form.

Each MCP product is formulated to provide different health benefits. These benefits range from blood detoxification, inhibiting cancer metastasis, and riding heavy metals from our system. They all have different purity and esterification levels. To better understand this, let’s look at a simplified test content report for a few MCP brands:

raluqqq43,1556023608,"Hi there.

I am kind of (very) scared and idk what to do. Few months ago a pink, scaly patch appeared on my right breast, next to the areola. It was kind of itchy so i went to the dermatologist and she told me it's just an eczema and gave me a cream/ointment. After a month of using it the patch didnt go away but it doesn't look that bad. Its not scaly anymore, is smaller and a very light pink. But it is still there.

I also had cracked nipples and very very sore, i couldn't touch them, the aureolas were swollen.  All of these eventually went away when i got my period. Now, every time my period comes i have tender breasts/nipples. Which i did not have before.

My right breast, the one with the patch, (but also the left breast) sometimes hurts, but it's not very painful, it's like someone pokes you lightly. 

Well, today when i woke up, i was feeling quite fine, nothing wrong.  This until like an hour ago when suddenly my left underarm started to hurt like hell. I cant even lift it, move it very far. I don't even move it and it still hurts. 

If any of you has advice i will gladly take it."
Live_Appearance,1555994829,"My left breast has always been a little larger than the other, but recently it has become more noticeable. It is swollen, feels heavy, and I have noticed a number of lumps that have gotten worse (kind of painful) over the past couple of weeks. I am not sure if I have additional stretch marks, or if that is just my imagination. I just finished my menstruation cycle and my right breast is not bothering me at all. I don't know if I have particularly dense breasts - I am small boned and about 130lbs. I have also lost weight recently and am down to a B cup.  


Had a chest X-ray and a clinical exam in the ER at the hospital 2 months ago. I was referred to its Breast Centre, and was scheduled for 2 appointments a week apart. First one was last week, and it was a unilateral ultrasound. They forwarded the results to my family doctor, who I just saw. She told me that my ultrasound was a BI-RADS 0. From what I'm understanding, a BI-RADS 0 means the results are inconclusive and requires further testing, OR could be that they need to look at previous imaging. About 2 years ago, I had gone to the same hospital and I had trouble breathing. I had a serious fall that broke my left leg. They told me I had a pseudomediastinum (air bubble in my chest). As it was the same hospital, they already have the records of this.   


I am hoping I have something like fat necrosis or a fibroadenoma, as I am only 30 years old. I do admit IBC has crossed my mind - for those who received those diagnoses, what was the screening process like? How quick did it happen for you?  


I have my follow-up appointment in a couple of days, and while the front desk didn't tell me I was seeing the doctor, they told me which doctor was going to be in that morning. Looking online, I see he is a surgeon.  


Has anyone ever received a BI-RADS 0 Ultrasound before? I am confused as to what the additional tests would be if it's not just a BI-RADS 4 or 5 that needs a biopsy?

If I have something benign, shouldn't they already know this by now with a clinical exam, chest x-ray, and an ultrasound? It is weird my second appointment was already scheduled. Is a mammogram and a chest x-ray much of a difference? Do they give you a heads up before a biopsy?

What advice can you offer ... I have had a double mastectomy 5 months ago with reconstruction. I still have issues with the range of movement in my arms. I had DCIS non invasive. No chemo etc. Have implants. They still feel tight on my chest. Had it out under pectoral so I feel my pectoral tighten often. The right sentinel node was removed so that side is sometimes more tight when I lift my arms up esp in the morning.
I still have difficulty putting my arms back of my head whilst on my back and sleeping on my sides are only tolerable for a short time. I feel a strained deep sort of pressure. There are some sensitive areas on the breast mostly on top and bottom but Still numb on most parts. Also the back of my arms towards the armpits still feel numb to touch although it has improved from a month ago. I have had PT sessions ( it helps but gets back to been tight ) 
I was wondering if this is all I should be doing or has someone had similar experience. Is this something that will eventually come right. Or is there anything better to try .?  I still try to do the exercises shown to me after the  mastectomy.

In November 2018 I went for a physical and my doctor did a clinical breast exam where she commented that my breasts feel “ropey” and she found a large lump near my nipple. The exam was painful on my right breast. My doctor commented that it was likely just a cyst due to my age and that breast cancer is rare (I’m 32). I was sent for an ultrasound. After changing out of my gown, I noticed a small amount of blood on my gown in the area where my nipple she examined was. I didn’t say anything at the time and brushed it off. 

My first ultrasound was one week later and the technician was awful. She made a comment that “women with your breasts don’t get cancer” and literally took the ultrasound in a quick circle around my breast, then said she was done. I was in and out of the exam room in 5 minutes including changing out of and into my clothes. My results came back Birads 1 and everything normal. There was no detail in the report.

I insisted on a second ultrasound as I can clearly feel a lump and did not think the tech took the situation seriously at all. My doctor hesitated but eventually agreed.

In December 2018 I had a mammogram and ultrasound. The results are still Birads 1 but there was a comment that I have areas of scattered density which appear benign, and one incidental cyst. The radiologist came in the room and asked if I was experiencing any other symptoms as they didn’t find anything but she mentioned there are other options if I’m symptomatic. At the time I was relieved at the result and had not had any symptoms so I said I was satisfied. She recommended I attend follow up with my doctor and she measure the lump. 

I saw my doctor in February who basically said nothing was found. I still feel a lump in my breast and she examined me again, looked perplexed and suggested I come back in 6 months so she can measure it. She has suggested yearly ultrasounds to monitor it.

Now I am starting to feel pain. My bra hurts to wear some days, I get a shooting pain to my nipple and when my husband hugs me it is uncomfortable and I can feel something there. I am feeling anxious and worried about waiting 6 months. I think some of that anxiety is because my paternal grandmother died from breast cancer at 42. 

I know that Birads 1 is a good result but something is telling me I should get a second opinion.  I just don’t want to come across as overly anxious or waste resources, and don’t know if my doctor will actually send me for any more tests//consults. 

Has anyone had a similar experience?"
IuliaTania,1555745542,"Hello. I have been recently diagnosed with triple negative, invasive ductal carcinoma. I will meet the oncologist Monday in order to establish the treatment plan. I am aware that it will involve chemotherapy. I was wondering if I could still go to work as usually, and how this will impact my performance. Should I take a leave of absence? I can get up to 90 days of paid medical leave, however I am a medic in a rural Eastern European community, and I would not feel comfortable with abandoning my patients. Not many healthcare professionals are keen to move to this area. On the other side, if I cannot deliver the best care to my patients, I should not practice until I am back to my regular self. What's your view on this?"

She's 61 and has two invasive ductal carcinoma masses with lobular features that are grade 2 in the left breast. No idea what any of this means. I know that one mass is 7mm and one is 6mm. We're meeting with a surgeon and a medical oncologist next week. I am starting to put a list of questions together to ask, including what stage this means she's at, how is this impacting her lymph nodes, and what comes next.

lendmeyourname,1555643879,"Sorry for the long post. I tried to only include pertinent information, but this may get a little rambly.

So my mom was just diagnosed with simultaneous breast and ovarian cancer a few months ago. She hasn't done the genetic testing yet but the oncologist feels very strongly that it is caused by a gene mutation. This lead me to do my first BSE where I found what feels like a very hard immoble lump to the left of my nipple, kind of right on top of a rib. It's worth noting that I'm very flat chested and my breasts are really squishy lately, so it's pretty easy to feel. After keeping an eye on it and starting to get some shooting pain in that breast, I finally saw the doctor yesterday.

When I showed her the lump, she said it felt like maybe a rib was out of place and that could be causing the random pain. She agreed that I should have a mammogram due to my mom's diagnosis but assured me that in her opinion it is likely nothing. When I asked how well a mammogram would work on my nonexistent boobs, she added an order for an ultrasound. 

My dilemma is that I have no insurance. My husband has been asking me if maybe I should wait a couple months until I'm eligible for a free screening (which would be a mammogram only). After the doctor brushed it off, I'm worried that I'm freaking out about nothing and am about to put my family in debt for no good reason. 

I had thyroid cancer about 12 years ago and have been low key paranoid about a recurrence since. But it really doesn't feel like this lump is part of my rib to me and the area has been weirdly sore since the exam. Am I overthinking this? I have until Monday to cancel my appointment. Any thoughts would be appreciated."

She found a lump, and ordered a stat mammogram and ultrasound. She had me go straight from her office to the imaging center and said they would fit me in.

After having the tests, the radiologist came in and said that I have three masses. Two at 10:00, 1.1 cm x 1.1 cm and 1.2 x 1.1 and then one at 9:00, 1.0 x .8 cm. She said they follow the duct line. She also said I have one suspicious axillary node that showed thickening. She said that it's encouraging that they are small.

Next up will be an ultrasound guided needle core biopsy. I'm trying not to assume, but I feel it's pretty safe to think that it isn't going to come back benign. Is there any realistic hope that it's all benign?

975268,1554843363,"In 2017 I went to the doctors because I found a pretty large, hard and noticeable lump on my left breast. I was sent for an ultrasound and a core needle biopsy. It turned out to be fibroadenoma, and not only did I have one but I had many. My doctor even said that my breast was the “lumpiest breast he’s ever seen.” They didn’t give me any information on whether I should be getting rechecked every year but I assumed that was because of my age.

Now this was when I was 19. I’m 21 now and my other breast has been causing me discomfort, to the point where it sometimes keeps me up at night. I went back to my GP and he believes the multiple sore lumps in my right breast are also fibroadenoma but he’s still sending me for another ultrasound. 

I have a history of breast cancer in my family, my grandma, aunt and my mom all are survivors. So my mom is really anxious about me and my breasts. 

My question is, how will I know if a lump is not just a fibroadenoma? When my mom found out she had breast cancer she didn’t have a lot of pain in her breast, so I’m scared that I might dismiss it as fibroadenoma until it’s too late.

To add on top of this, to get an ultrasound or mammogram you have to be referred by your GP each time. I felt silly yesterday when I went in concerned about my breast because my doctor somewhat dismissed my worries (I think because it’s very uncommon for a person my age to get breast cancer) and only referred me to get an ultrasound to please me.

Should I be adamant about getting my breasts checked every year? Or should I not worry until I’m older because the likelihood of me having breast cancer is low at my age?"

eaj0112,1554692544,"Hello, so I don’t know if this is the right place to ask this... but please help.

So my mom did a breast cancer scanning (she’s 62 years old) and they found a lump in her breast. It’s about 1.3 centimeters. We don’t have a history of breast cancer in our family at all. After that, she did the ultrasound, and the doctor said he feels it is most likely cancer. (He also happens to be one of the top ten breast cancer doctor/surgeon in New York.) Our whole family was very scared, and they did a biopsy on her. Let me tell you, every second felt like hours and we couldn’t sleep at night, we are already going through a ton of stuff, and we did not want my mom’s health to decline as it would literally kill us.....


So the doctor said it’s not cancer, but he says he was so sure it was cancer because of how big it was. He then suggested surgery, and said that he has to test the lump once it’s removed again because there may be traces of cancer on other parts of the lump, not the part he checked..... does this sound right...? Or am I overreacting? I mean i understand preparing us for the worst, but saying it’s most likely cancer and then the results coming back negative kind of angered me in some way. He could have said let’s just do a biopsy and see....but saying that it is cancer when it wasn’t...


But now my mom is questioning if she should get the surgery done. She’s asking me if there are people out there that was asked to remove the lump but decided not to, and wants to know if they are fine... I think she’s somewhat scared of the surgery. So I’d like to know if anyone here had a lump that was non-cancerous and ended up leaving it, if yes, how you feel... thank you."

I put on some compression hose I had from when I was pregnant. I’m hoping that will help keep it from getting worse. Has anyone had any experience with anything like this? Is it just a side effect that will go away? Is there anything else I should be doing?

My mother-in-law has really terrible lymphedema in one leg from when she was in an accident when she was younger and I’m honestly terrified of that happening to me. She always has so many problems with her leg."
tamorage,1554472493,"I’m worried and I feel like my oncologist isn’t really listening. It also costs me $75 to see her, even with insurance, so I can’t talk to her about my issues as often as I would like. 

I started Tamoxifen 5 months ago after a mastectomy for stage 1a breast cancer in my left breast. DX score was 4 so no chemo or radiation necessary. Good news! I only have to take this tiny pill for 10 years. Super easy but it isn’t, is it? 

I knew there may be night sweats and bone pain but I experienced none of that. No thinning hair. No change in libido. I feel fantastic actually. I was lucky. 

Until about 2 months in I started progressively having issues with not being able to control my anger. I get irritability is common but this was more than just being angry and annoyed. It was rage. Simple things or even nothing at all would just set me off. At work I had leave meetings and ended up breaking a piece off the copier and hid it just out of spite. 

The only place I didn’t rage was at home with my husband and child but the minute I left the house it was like a switch went on. I daydreamed about shoving things down people’s throats, sitting things on fire, ripping out eye balls. I once saw someone fail to signal and I had to legitimately stop myself from ramming his car into a tree. I had to pull over it was so bad. Just looking at a dog sets me off too. I just want to punch them and I don’t know why I feel like that. 

I have tried breathing exercises and other calming techniques but they don’t do anything. All I think about it hurting things. I have found ways to cope. Rough sex seems to calm me down. Directed verbal insults work too. If I can get someone to insult me or hurt me in some way. If I shut my hand in something or knock my leg hard against something the rage usually goes away for a while and I can breathe again. Fear works really well too. If I can get myself scared the rage usually subsided. 

This is totally out of character for me. I am usually very against violence and fighting but now I am in constant fight mode. All I want to do is rip a throat out. 

My oncologist says irritability is common and so is depression but this isn’t JUST depression. I don’t know how to get her to listen to me without screaming in her face “ look all I want to do right now is burn this whole place down and it has all I have been thinking about during this 2 hour wait and believe me when I say I have planned it out in my head” without sounding like a homicidal maniac. 

I tried a new healthy diet. I cut out caffeine 5 months ago so I am good there. No other medications. Exercising just makes the rage worse. Like I would exercise for an hour and somehow get more energy to want to rip someone’s face off. I was this close to keying this wonderful coworkers car because it was a color that just made me fly into a rage. I can’t explain it. I had to go home and take an antihistamine to make myself go to sleep just to get over it. Those help too by the way. Anything that makes me sleepy. Like really sleepy. If I can sleep then at least I am not having to keep myself from destroying property or person. 

I was having dreams and day dreams about murder and assault so I stopped taking the tamoxifen about 2 weeks ago and all that is gone. The rage is going away. I feel like myself and healthy again. I am scared to go back on them. I have never hurt anything my entire life and I hate feeling like I am in literal fight mode all the time. 

My husband said it was like I was another person. The amount of rough sex I needed was starting to worry him too. Now with the tamoxifen stopped he says he sees me coming back again. 

Maybe it is just me. I can find tons of information on people being angry on them but not like this. This can’t be common. I reached out to get a referral to another oncologist but I have to wait 45 days to see them. 

Has anyone else had this much rage when taking tamoxifen? I just want to know if it is just me or if this is even a rare side effect of this medication? 

This was way more than a mood swing. I felt like a rage zombie. "

Littlefin77,1554413500,I'm waiting for my biopsy lab work.  I found a 1.6 cm mass on my breast and mammogram/ultrasound prompted biopsy.  I have had the longest scariest week of my life. I have a 5 year old and husband to live for.  I don't want to die.  How do I get thru this?  My friends just say to stay positive but it's just easier said than done.  How do you get thru the unknown?
basementjams,1554391129,"I have a history of eczema, and it can get pretty bad in the winter. But it’s always only been on my legs, never anywhere else. Well now I have something similar to eczema on my left nipple/areola, and I can’t help but worry. It’s been here since December, I believe. I do still have some eczema on my leg however. 

Last month, I went to a planned parenthood to get my nipple checked out. The nurse practitioner fully examined my breasts, and said she didn’t feel any lumps in my breasts or behind my nipple. She said I may need to see a dermatologist, and that it wasn’t a breast issue. It’s hard to find reassurance in that, when you read about how breast cancer can be misdiagnosed as eczema. :( 

If I keep it moisturized, it usually won’t flake or look crusty, but the areola remains pink and my nipple just looks weird. I don’t have any nipple discharge, but my nipple and a “ring” around my areola gets so raised and wrinkly anytime it touches something. My other breast looks completely normal. 

Quite frankly, I’m so exhausted from worrying about this nonstop. I haven’t had any breast pain, just a lot of itchiness. 

I don’t have any health insurance, but at this point, I need peace of mind. 

What do I do? Go to another planned parenthood for a second opinion? Get an ultrasound? There’s no history of breast cancer in my family, besides my grandma getting noncancerous cysts removed.  

"
masterlione,1554324114,"I’m 21, and my left nipple hasn’t been the same since January, I noticed redness and a sensitivity to it that if touched sent a shooting pain through my breast. The skin around my nipple started to flake and my nipples were much darker than they are normally. In February my nipple started secreting a golden discharge that dried hard, I thought my nipple somehow became chaffed or chapped and with advisement of my doctor we went with antibiotic and anti-fungal creams and a bandage. We are now at the point where there is a small amount of blood in the discharge and I’m soaking though my bandaid and my bra. We can’t feel anything with an exam so my ultrasound is scheduled for Friday. 

I’ve never been pregnant and I have an IUD so I’m definitely not pregnant now. 

My other boob is fine and my doctor wanted to prepare me and told me that it could very possibly  be signs of pagets.  

I’m pretty stressed about it I have a strong family history of BC but I didn’t think I would be worrying about it this soon. Any ideas or experiences would be appreciated. "

LongjumpingAmoeba0,1554292834,"The nurse called me last night to let me know my mammogram came back suspicious and they want more views and an ultrasound.  This isn't the first time so that didn't alarm me initially but then she said I needed to come back in for a breast exam (just had one at my well visit) and they might decide to refer me to a surgeon.  That is what freaked me out.  I know I shouldn't worry when I literally know nothing yet but I am.  

I was just released from 6 month mammo and ultrasounds because they were following a oval well-defined 13 mm mass in my right breast that showed up on a mammogram I had after finding a small lump.  The small lump was biopsied and found to be benign.  The 13 mm mass wasn't felt by me or my doctors.   They followed it for like a year and half and then said it seems to be not changing and they aren't worried and I can go back to yearly screening.  So a year past and I get my screening and get the call last night.  I want to believe its the same spot and they are just going back to being careful but I am really worried they saw a change.   "
amj142,1554271042,"21 y/o female. For almost two years, doctors haven’t taken my breast concerns seriously because the changes were so slight. Now, my nipples are itchy, discharging, scaly, veins are showing across my chest, I have an indent on the side of my breast that has gotten deeper, and my armpit lymph nodes are swollen. I’ve been taking birth control daily, I started at 16 with an estrogen and progestin one. Now I’m on a progestin only one. I do not have a diagnosis, because no lump was found in any of my SEVERAL breast exams. But something isn’t right, and my breast has started shrinking along with these changes. My breast skin is also extremely...I don’t know the right words. It’s like it’s soft and easy to pull. None of my skin anywhere else on me feels that way. Is taking birth control without an official diagnosis harming me worse...? I’m really hoping it’s some 1 in a million condition and not breast cancer, I’m trying very hard to stay optimistic. I’m hoping to meet with a breast specialist before the end of the week, because at this point I’ve been told by the doctor who gave my last breast exam to go straight to a specialist because if the ultrasound didn’t show anything, the mammogram might not either. Should I stop the birth control? I’m so scared I’m hurting myself worse.

sandra171,1554255412,"So i've had a breast lump for a while now (over a year maybe a year and a half) it's painful sometimes so I finally went to the doctor, I didn't go earlier because I was only 17 when I found it (now 19) and for some reason people I thought young people don't run the chance of getting breast cancer so I didn't think I needed to get it checked out. My boyfriend and I went to the doctor and i was given a breast exam which confirmed what i already know (that i had a lump). I was told I had a very firm mobile lump in my left breast that was roughly about 2 cm in size. I was referred to a different office to get an ultrasound. I went to my ultrasound and three days later got two letters in the mail one from the clinic I went to get the breast exam and one from the imaging center where I got the ultrasound. The one from the imaging center says they found an abnormality (which I was expecting since I could feel it) and that they needed further testing based on what they found but that it was something I needed to talk to my doctor with. The one from the clinic says that I should call to schedule a breast surgery (keep in mind i haven't even spoken to the doctor about the results) so i'm thinking to myself ""Surgery?! why? what is going on? I call the place and they were having problems with the clinic sending the referral to the hospital where i'm supposed to have ""surgery"" (which I don't know why yet). When I call to make appointments the people always feel very worried for me (Do they know something I don't? or Are they just trying to comfort me so i'm not worried?) I get a call from the hospital where i'm supposed to have the surgery and they tell me that the doctor that I originally met and had the breast exam with at the clinic which was the same one who ordered the ultrasound says, ""she's not comfortable enough to deal with my situation and that she has referred me to a specialist."" (What does this mean? Am I supposed to be worried? I'm not I for some reason I don't think that anything is wrong but with everything happening and them sending me do a lot of different places without telling me what is going on and why i'm getting stuff done is starting to freak me out a bit.) I have my first appointment with the specialist next week on Monday (April 08). What should i expect i'm kinda starting to worry because i feel like this might be more serious than I thought and now I feel bad because if it is I put it off for a long time and it could have been attended to sooner. Can anyone share their personal experiences; i'm curious to know if the whole process i'm going through is normal or if this could be something more serious. Any help is appreciated. I will update you guys after i get my results."
OneBlondeMama,1554217676,"Went for yearly mammogram yesterday.  Now trying to stay calm until results.

Felt a lump a couple of months ago. No biggie - have always had fibroadenoma - we're lumpy women in my family.  Due for the yearly mammogram anyway. Saw the doctor &amp; she made the mammo appt.  (family history - Mom &amp; sister both survived breast cancer - two different types)

I've had a few scares before - even had to have a biopsy before. But have always had to do the ""normal"" steps of mammo, then ultrasound, then MRI, THEN the biopsy. We just skipped a step yesterday. Straight to the biopsy. When the doctor came in to show me the pics, there's actually two, she said that they're ""really ugly looking"".  Biopsy went as easy as one can.

DH is going with me tomorrow for the results (doctor suggestion).  Couldn't sleep, can't stop thinking about things.  Basically trying not to panic.  And because of the black blotch on ultrasound &amp; mammo, I've named it ""Dementor"" (I name everything and I thought it was an appropriate name for this damn thing)."
A_nicksNY,1554216851,"For starters let me start off by saying hi my name is Ashley 👋🏼 i have NOT been diagnosed with BC, i have no history of BC in my family apart from my great grandmother on my mother’s fathers side (but from what i gather it really doesn’t matter) but honestly i came here for advice because i have questions about lumps and bumps, what’s normal and what’s not and i feel like you ladies are so smart and the best to ask. I have lumpy breasts, my left is lumper than my right. A couple months ago i went to my primary to ask about an area i felt was lumpier than the other side, she did a nice thorough exam and told me that although it does feel lumpier that it was just normal breast tissue and that i have lumpy breasts and it’s fine that one boob is a little more lumpy than the other. You’d think at 27 i would be more knowledgeable about this stuff but i hate to say I’m not. She taught me how to do a SBE and told me every month to give them a once over. 


My problem is how do I distinguish between my normal lumps and bumps and ones that need checking? How hard is “hard” - I’m just very confused and was wondering if you ladies could help me because I’m trying to be proactive about my breast health while also not falling down a rabbit hole every time I go over my same lumps..."
jinxedtimes2,1554187152,"So earlier today, my doctor gave me the results of a biopsy I got last week and told me I have invasive ductal carcinoma. Then I had to leave the doctor’s office for a job interview (!).

I’m finishing up a fellowship in two months, upon which time I need to get a job. I’m pretty deep in the interview process with a couple of potential employers...and now this happens.

I know that getting a new job probably shouldn’t be my highest priority now, it is a concern because I will need insurance and an income to get through the next stages of whatever fresh hell is coming my way. 

So I have a lot of questions. Should I tell a potential employer about my pending treatment? Is it possible to start a new job while getting chemo? Also, a new job will likely involve relocation, so my treatment may have to be moved to a new medical team and insurance while in progress. Is that a bad idea?

attackturtle88,1554176139,"I am about 3.5 years post mastectomy of my left breast.  I was Stage 2, 38 years old.  This morning I woke at 4:00 a.m with excruciating pain in the left side of my neck radiating into my left arm.

I have been working out at Orange Theory about 5-6 times a week for the past two months, but don’t recall pulling anything.  

I went to my PC today and met with a PA who gave me Naproxen and a muscle relaxer.  He told me insurance companies don’t want imaging ordered unless the pain has been going on for six weeks.

My husband (represents doctors legally) thinks imaging needs to be ordered.  

It’s been less than one day; however the meds have had zero effect on my pain and I feel like I have a 100 knives being stabbed in my back when I am lying in bed (1000 knives when I try to get up).

I’ve been having a lot of breast pain for some time now.. It used to come and go, I’m not certain it’s tied to my menstrual cycle... I’ve had breast pain this ENTIRE month since my last period. It’s unreal... I’ve stopped wearing a bra just to free them up a bit. But movement generally hurts... sometimes it does come and go still.. but a few days ago I was driving around with a friend and literally had to pull over the car to just sit there and grab my right boob because I kept feeling sharp pains. That was just the one boob at the time... but the pain isnt in any one place, its like all over and changes.. like it shifts from different areas but they generally feel kind of inflamed overall. I had to buy nipple cream for pregnant women at one point because my nipples where so sore and itchy too. I’ve been feeling around for lumps, but cant seem to find anything significant.. I’m just a little worried because breast cancer has been pretty common in my family... So thought I’d ask around before seeing a doctor... Though I’m seriously, seriously not keen on going for a mammogram... like I have a MEGA fear of putting my boobs in what’s basically a vice for breasts... mine are already sore enough to touch. I’ve heard women say it can be painful... Are there any alternatives like an ultrasound or something? "

Another thing is my neck has been breaking out in pimples. 

Also I noticed 1) the nipples look darker/purple and 2) maybe even splotchy if that makes sense. On March 12, I went to the Dr for antibiotics for a cough and since I had to do an Xray, they did a pregnancy test first. Did the Xray so I'm thinking the test was negative.

Went to a breast specialist this week and she felt around and suggested Aquafor. That's all. No pregnancy test, mention of the pimples, nothing.

PaperCats4,1553786787,"So, I live in Canada and I just had a breast ultrasound a week ago. I wanted to check up on an old lump I've had since I was 19 (I'm 29 now). It hasn't changed shape but I wanted to make sure it was still just a cyst. What worried me is that the side of my breast is also VERY fibrous and lumpy during my period and the ultrasound tech marked it as an ""area of interest"" and then went to speak to the radiologist. Then, she came back in and told me I was all set to leave and that I would have results in a week or sooner. But, I haven't received a call. I don't have a family doctor and it was the doctor at the walk-in clinic that ordered the test. Who do I call for results? I don't remember who the doctor was that ordered the ultrasound because it was so long ago.   


Is it normal to wait this long for ultrasound results? What if it is cancer and I need a biopsy and they wait too long to tell me? "
sure_okay99,1553734989,"I recently did a breast examination, went in for a breast examination, and both nurse practitioner and I agree that my left breast does feel thicker than my right and there's a marbled sized mass just above the nipple; I believe she mentioned there's a couple smaller ones in the left as well. 
As of right now I'm not experiencing pain, nipple discharge/inversion, puckering of the skin, other common BC symptoms. It's just a lump a little over 3cm and my breast feels overall thicker and looks fuller/more swollen than my right. Also now that I'm thinking about it my left breast does hurt a little bit from pressure on it compared to my right not hurting at all.
What really worries me is that this is a very new development (I do breast examinations often) and I'm experiencing nothing like this in my right breast. In fact, my right breast feels completely normal, nothing different. 
I'm 19 and as far as I know there's no history of breast cancer but there's no information about that beyond my aunts, uncles, and parents. I know statistically it's unlikely but I'm terrified, and even if my ultrasound comes back clear should I push for a biopsy just in case? I really don't know if this is completely benign or the beginning of something more serious. Any and all information would be helpful!"
Bumblebee_Hybrid,1553717975,"Brief Story- 

    My wife has been battling breast cancer for a while, and 18 months ago, it metastasized into her brain and other areas.   After all of the radiation treatment that she was capable of having (whole brain as well as repeated smaller doses in other places), she was put on a few medications that are supposed to cross the blood brain barrier.  

The names of the medications are capecitabine and lapatinib.  The former, cape, is a chemo.  Lapatinib, I believe, is an anti-hormonal drug.  

According to some of the research I found (googling it), some previous studies on patience with a similar prognosis and diagnosis have shown up to a 30% reduction in their brain lesions 6 months after starting treatment.  

My wife did not respond like this at six months, in fact she had more lesions in her brain.  The Dr. literally asked us if we wanted to continue treatment at all or focus on 'being as comfortable as possible....' 

My wife decided to fight on and keep taking the chemo as prescribed while I searched all over www.clinicaltrials.gov for a clinical trial for us to enter.  

5 months after that (11 months total on the drug), my wife is still around and not a whole lot worse than before.   The Dr. was happy to see this and ordered an MRI.   

Her MRI, for the very first time, shows **FEWER** lesions in her head than last time.   Not a whole lot fewer, but sure as hell not any more and the report *does* say 'slightly fewer.'   

We are extremely grateful for this.  I wanted to share the news in case anyone else is on these two drugs and is not having the desired results earlier on; I figured this information may be relevant.  

In other news, we were accepted into a clinical trial and will start an experimental treatment **if** her prognosis goes the other way (i.e.-  they won't start the trial while her current treatment seems to be working.  It is there in case her treatment stops being effective). 

And for this,  my fellow redditors, we express our graciousness to the Universe.

 - if they find something suspicious will they tell me right then and there? 
- will I be able to watch the screen while they are performing the ultrasound? 
- can I ask any specific questions that will help me understand if they found anything, without them revealing anything they aren’t allowed to tell me? (I’ve heard the ultrasound technicians aren’t allowed to reveal results)
-  if I am able to see the screen would anything out of the ordinary be easily visible to me? (As someone who has no background in the health field)

Because of the mammogram (that was done over a year ago), the doctor didnt think it was necessary to have an ultrasound done.

divinearcanum,1553520906,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2016 when I was 29. I had my first dose of chemo on my 30th birthday. I powered through it all and am now on hormonal treatment even though I am cancer-free. I feel like what people don't understand is that, even though I look normal now, I still have nerve damage in my fingers and my body is now twice as old as it should be. Everything came to a head yesterday where I was trying to get dressed for my sister-in-law's birthday party and I just broke down with uncontrollable bawling. I have difficulty wearing button-ups because buttons are hard with the nerve damage. I spent $300 on all new clothes just late last season and now none of them fit. My upper body is fit and unchanging due to my fake breasts but I can't wrap my head around all the weight and mass that has been added to my thighs, hips, stomach. I can't wear most jeans because my skin is super sensitive thanks to chemo. I can't find ones that fit a tall/curvy woman. I am lamenting that I have to get rid of all these clothes and figure out how to dress a body of a woman that is much older than me. I lament to my doctors all the time. I'm doing everything: exercise, watching my diet, etc etc. and nothing helps.

I am still depressed from yesterday and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like anyone really understands me and I was hoping I could find someone here who has some advice or can just share these feelings with me. I hate this right now. I hate that I feel this way and that I hate myself. I don't know what to do. I'm so uncomfortable all the time. I feel disgusting with my scars and I feel like I can't say how I feel because I either have to be strong for my family or I feel like my friends don't want to hear me complain about this while they are in the next stages of adult life.

lisanycbc,1553401060,"Posted about 2 months ago asking about taking care of myself after lumpectomy and radiation treatment, and deciding if I should tell my family or not.  I finally decided to tell my mom over video chat a few days before the surgery, so she won't have time to worry too much and try to come out to NY.  

I have stage 1 BC ER/PR+ and HER2-. Got the lumpectomy and and am 1/2 through my radiation.  Things are looking up. 

I've been a little anxious about the oncotypeDx result and needing chemo because of my failing kidney.  I got diagnosed with BC during my 2nd kidney transplant evaluation.  I received a kidney from my mother 18 years ago and the transplanted kidney is failing (they don't last forever) and was getting evaluated to get on the transplant list when I was diagnosed with BC. 

I was afraid the chemo will put me into total end stage kidney failure and will have to go on dialysis.  I was so worried, I really don't think I can take on additional challenge at this point.  I'm also diabetic who started on multiple daily injection therapy not too long ago.  That's also been challenging.  I became diabetic due to side affect of one of immunosupressent medication 

I received a call from my MO on late Friday and she told me my oncotypeDx score came back and it was low, which is a great news for me.  

So all these medical issues were piling up, and feeling fatigue because I wasn't eating enough, because I didn't really want to give myself needle injection any more than I had to, and because of my failing kidneys and anemia.  

There has been bad days when I just cried and felt sorry for myself and asked why why why.  It's just not fair for one person to be burden with so much.  

Then again I look at the other side of my life and think how lucky I am.  

I'm thankful for wonderful people like my breast cancer medical team.  I'm thankful for the doctor calling me late Friday to tell me about my oncotypeDx score.  I'm thankful for my husband and family, and I'm thankful for everyone sharing their stories and knowledge on this subreddit.  

I have a plan for myself, I'll get my anemia under control with monthly EPO injections.  I'll probably ask to get an insulin pump so I'll have better control of my diabetes and can eat more, and I'll start lifting weights to get stronger.  Finally, I'll get through radiation so I can get back on track of getting on the transplant list, might not be able to get on the list for a few years now that I've had cancer but I'll fight for it. 

Things are getting better and it will get better.

  [Found a lump. Have appointment, but could use help to navigate arriving with important info, asking the right questions, taking the right steps?](https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/auwtrf/found_a_lump_have_appointment_but_could_use_help/)

[Mammogram (and possibly ultrasound) tomorrow. How should I prepare?](https://www.reddit.com/r/breastcancer/comments/b2q3aa/mammogram_and_possibly_ultrasound_tomorrow_how/

I came here late last month, asking what the hell to do, how to approach my finding a lump, and the experience and emotions I was about to go through. 

I got into my doctor within 2 days. He was able to instantly palpate the lump, and also found several others. He immediately ordered several tests: Blood (Prolactin level because I'd been having slightly odd discharge), Mammogram, and Ultrasound. 

I completed the blood draw within an hour of leaving the office. (Tests came back with a normal level)

For the other tests, it felt like forever for them to call and schedule. I was so anxious, I called them several times myself, but they were waiting for specific info to be confirmed first. Once I was called (5 days later), the appointment was made for the 19th in the late afternoon.)

I cannot tell you how amazing the experience was; I'm not being flippant. I was treated with such care and kindness, it pretty well overwhelmed and calmed any other negative emotion. Additionally, my SO of nearly 5 years was allowed to accompany me to every room, save for mammography. 

The mammogram took maybe 5 minutes to complete. The tech was obviously knowledgeable, concise, but also comforting in perfect measure. She even offered to show me my images immediately, and explained some anatomical info (not going into results info/details that the radiologist would be covering soon). I cannot explain how much less difficult, painful, uncomfortable, or even strange this was compared to what I'd built up in my mind. (I've felt more discomfort from sleeping in the wrong position than was caused here; Don't let this ever be a reason to not get checked!)

I was then almost immediately taken in to an ultrasound suite, the imaging was complete within another 5 minutes, and after a short wait, the radiologist came in and informed me/us that *everything* appeared normal. He explained that it's likely these changes are from aging, and having fibrous breasts, but that I'd done the right thing and that it's actually great to have this info on file as a baseline should I ever have another worrisome lump, or even once yearly exams are suggested. 

So there it is. I'm very grateful to all of you, and will not take this entire experience, and outcome,  for granted. A huge weight was lifted from me, but with your support, I did feel ready to tackle anything that came my way."

I am type 1 diabetic also. Thanks again."
flavia_deluce,1553321254,"Has anyone had a flap reconstruction after mastectomy? I’m in the process of chemo for stage 2 triple positive cancer. The tumor involves my nipple and skin so my surgeon wants to do a mastectomy. I was assuming I would just get an implant, but when I met with the plastic surgeon she suggested TRAM or DIEP flap reconstruction since my breasts are “too big” for an implant (44DD and wide). The idea of flap reconstruction was new to me. Seems like it has benefits (will grow/shrink naturally, tummy tuck bonus) but also kind of scary, super involved surgery. Does anyone have any stories, info or advice? "

MathCampNerd,1553288114,"Hi guys, I've never posted here before and the wait is just driving me so I wanted to see if I could get anyone to talk to or information or anything at all. 

I'm 27 years old in Canada. Ive had cyst in my breast for a while that had always come back as nothing. Recently I found a lump in my armpit so I had an ultrasound done last week and they scheduled a core needle biopsy for Thursday. 

I just got my results yesterday and I was told I have invasive ductal carcinoma 2. I assume that's because it's in my lymph node.  My GP told me so I'm waiting for hear from the cancer clinic before we go farther, but I'm having a hard time not spirally. If anyone has idea on what may happen next, or any tips or tricks to deal with the wait I'd greatly appreciate it."
watchingweeds,1553283471,"Hey, I’m 27 F, as the title says I have the BRCA1 gene. Most women in my family have had breast cancer and it’s pretty aggressive. I’m highly considering the prophylactic mastectomy and wondering if anyone has any info or advice? 

I’ve heard that your body can reject implants and I was wondering  about my future ability to breastfeed/ if I would still have sensation in my nipples. Just wondering if anyone has had this operation and what they know.

Thanks so much for any advice or help!"
Trugus1,1553231173,"Currently I have stage 4 breast cancer that has metastasized in my liver. I don’t want to do treatments again, but I’m struggling with lots of pain. Dr. prescribed meds but it makes my stomach upset especially if I don’t eat anything and leaves a metallic taste in my mouth. I’m looking for any recommendations."
PaperCats4,1553202291,"I'm 29 with no history of breast cancer. Mom has fibrous breasts and is prone to cysts which are always benign. When I was 19, I found a round lump in my breast tissue near my nipple. Got two ultrasounds and they both came back as fluid-filled benign cyst but the doctor recommended I follow up with one ultrasound a year for two years to make sure there were no changes. I was living in the US at the time and had no insurance so I couldn't afford it.   


I moved back to Canada this year and got my healthcare so I decided to go get it checked out. I've always assumed I have fibrous breasts. They're small so I can clearly feel the super lumpy tissue on both breasts. It's mostly on the outside near my armpits and it becomes super lumpy and painful during my period. I'm currently on my period now and my appointment was today. The cyst near the nipple looked the same as far as I could tell on the screen. But the ultrasound tech went to the lumpy part on the outside of my breast and marked it as ""area of interest"" on the screen. After the ultrasound she told me to stay there for a moment and she called the radiologist on the phone. They whispered a bit and I couldn't hear what she was saying. She then came back in and told me that I was all done and my doctor would call me in a bit over a week if there were issues. I asked if I would get results if there weren't issues and she said ""I can see you're worried so call your doctor in a little over a week for the results"".   


I'm so scared. What's this ""area of interest"" thing and why did she call the radiologist after? That never happened during the two ultrasounds I had in the states. If I have cancer and it has been sitting there for years, it's probably super advanced, right? How can I stop myself from freaking out for the next week? I want to cry. "
EchoGrae,1553198608,"I am 29/F and have found a third lump in my left breast. I found the first one in 2016 or so, had it checked via ultrasound, doc said it was likely a fibroadenoma and to come back in 6 months. The visit was so expensive, even with my insurance, that I never went back. Not even when I found the second lump some months later. I'm living somewhere new now, do NOT have insurance, and have now found a third. All in the same breast, all totally painless with the exception of PMS swelling, all hard like marbles and varying sizes that do not seem to ever move or change.

I can't afford a check of these lumps, and especially if they are all just fibroadenomas! And yet I know I should go anyway and hope for some kind of payment plan because breast cancer runs in the family pretty heavily. But I mean... if I DO have cancer, what then? I absolutely cannot afford treatment. 

I'm not sure what I'm after here, I just needed to share. My mom is insistent I go look at it and yet seems to have 0% interest in the fact that I barely have enough money for bills and food and checking a lump is not in my budget. I mean it just seems pointless if it's nothing? Why bother?"

ClevelandCatLady,1553090282,"Hi!  I have gone through all of my cancer treatments while on Medicaid. I was attending school and working for myself part time. 

I am about to finish school and want to job hunt, but I am concerned about the costs of my remaining treatments. 

Currently I have a nipple reconstruction and two fat grafting operations left, as well as a possible ovary/tube removal.  Though if I can get the ovaries out soon enough that surgery might not be a factor. 

I am in a medical study, so much of my blood work and I believe monthly aromatase inhibitor is covered by them. 

Is anyone comfortable discussing the possible costs I can expect from what I have left? Even if it’s just some rough estimates. I am struggling to find any information out there. 

I would likely move into management in the hotel/banquet world, which is not always known for great insurance. I am not interested in increasing my income and working in my field, only to have it reduced to below my part-time self employment income due to high out of pocket costs. 

Thanks for reading!"
Nishi0kaNa0mi,1553060080,"I'm down to my last three sessions of chemo. I sti have to have radiation after, but I spoke to my oncologist today about medication options.

He said that since I am premenopausal, I could go with tamoxifen. Or I could have shots every month (I think he said Lupron) and induce menopause and take Arimidex.

He said he recommended the Arimidex rather than the tamoxifen because tamoxifen had a higher risk of stroke, blood clots, and recurrence of cancer. I'm a little worried about Arimidex though because my mothers side of the family tends toward osteoporosis and she has it pretty bad.

He also said that having my ovaries removed was an option if I didn't want to have the shots every month. I'm not planning on any more children, so I'm okay with this option too if I have to.

I would appreciate it if you could share your experiences with any of these. I keep finding scary side effects when I google."

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, especially what questions I should ask if something/nothing is found, or ways to make the exams as easy as possible.

ReadRoses,1552875413,I’m 14 and I did one the breaths check things today and my breast were sort of lumpy. They both had big one big lump in the middle of them. But as far as I can remember they’ve been there. Is this just how breasts are supposed to feel? Or something else.

I haven’t been on vacation since 2007.... I also have a smaller vacation that is in June so I guess we will see. 
But even though today reminds me of that, I am a little better emotionally. Though I’m worried bc most people say their cancer didn’t hurt.    My lumps HURT! Badly, especially after biopsies, but even before, that’s how I found it. So has anyone else felt that? It’s throbbing. I hope everyone is well. ❤️Jaylee"

AClownKilledMyDad,1552851734,"I’m more afraid of the procedure than I am of the potential results. I’ve had a fear of needles my entire life... I’ve avoided badly needed dental treatment and I walked in to the hospital five minutes before my baby was born just to avoid the needles. I have PTSD and needles just make it worse.  I am so sick of doctors telling me “you’ll be fine” when I tell them how severe my fear is. 

I have to talk to my primary care doctor tomorrow since my mammogram and US were on Friday. The radiologist found a very small lump (7mm) and recommenced a core needle biopsy. Can I request general anesthesia? I had it when I had my wisdom teeth taken out and handled it perfectly fine.  If I request to have the entire lump removed instead of the core needle biopsy, could I request general anesthesia in that case? I have a strong family history of breast cancer and I would just want the lump gone anyway.  I can’t stop crying and I have nightmares every time I sleep.

WorkingConnection,1552794764,"Hey. So just a random person here (F20). 

But my nipple has been flaking and peeling a bit recently. I thought nothing of it bc I currently have a psoriasis flare up on my hand. But upon reading, I found out it could be Paget’s Disease, a rare form of breast cancer. My breasts feel fine (I think). So I hope I’m just overthinking what the internet has to say. Any advice is appreciated. "
Beautiful_Midnight88,1552765623,"My main question is whether it is normal for the lymph nodes to be scanned and photographed during an ultrasound looking at a suspicious area after a routine mammogram screening? I'm also wondering if there is anything else about my ultrasound that might raise suspicion. At the moment, I am probably needlessly anxious because I don't feel I have enough knowledge to properly assess the situation. Google is fully providing the information I am looking for.

Some background: I am 30F. My mother's side (French Canadian) has a history of breast cancer, but so far, no gene defect has been found. My mom has 3 sisters. My grandmother (70s), Aunt 2 (48 pre-menopause), Aunt 3 (55) and Aunt 1's daughter, my cousin (40), have all had breast cancer, as well as two of my mom's cousin. I recently saw a genetic counselor, and based on my cousin's age at diagnosis, she recommended I start getting yearly mammograms now. 

I went for my first mammogram on Friday, March 8. When I was called in by the  technician, she asked me all types of questions, including who recommended I get a mammogram. She told me ultrasounds were better at my age because the breasts are so dense. She also told me that I might get a call to come back for further testing before the mammogram was done.

The following Monday, I got a call from the imaging center asking me to schedule a follow up ultrasound. I was not told why, nor did I ask. It worried me a little, but I figured my breasts were just too dense, like the first technician said, so they were playing it safe. The ultrasound was booked for 4 days later.

Yesterday, I went to my appointment. I went in convinced it was just a further routing screening that would probably show nothing. They accidentally skipped me, and my son had an appointment I had to take him to later that afternoon, so it may have been a little rushed. She gave me the gown and left me in the ultrasound room to undress. After I lied down, she I told me it was just for my left breast. I began to worry a little because I was expecting a full scan. I have since read that one breast can be more dense than the other, so perhaps that was the case.

The ultrasound technician started on the top, where she did not take any pictures. Finally, when she got to the bottom of my breast, she started taking pictures. She took many at different angles, beginning with pushing it upwards right against my ribs. She seemed to be aiming at a specific spot. So now I'm thinking there was probably a suspicious area or mass, which I have also read is quite common and usually benign. But at this point during the exam, I start to think the worst.

She then had me turn on my side and took some more pictures of the same area. After that, she began taking pictures more in my armpit. I know that's where they would check lymph nodes, and I know if lymph nodes are involved, the breast cancer would be more progressed. At the time I took this to be very bad. After that she left the room to allow me to get dressed. I quickly looked at the computer screen, which was not visible to me during the exam. I could see that she took 24 pictures, and the last three, which I assume would of been of the lymph nodes, were still displayed. The second last picture had a box around something. I can't remember if there was a visible circular band, but I do know it was white and squiggly.

I left without being told anything. I assume the results will go back to my family doctor, and then they will call me if there is anything to discuss. Unfortunately, the ultrasound was performed on a Friday afternoon, so I wont hear anything until Monday at the very least. I have since felt my left breast from every angle trying to figure out what they were looking at. The problem I have always had with self checking is that I have large breasts and it always feels like there are multiple lumps and areas with substantial tissue. I could find something in the area, but how do I know that isn't just one of my normal lumps? 

To anyone who took the time to read the above novel and provides feedback, you have my utmost gratitude!"
Ambigu1ty,1552756406,"So I am almost 33 years old, and have had some sharp, intermittent pain in ol' lefty for several months now. I went for a physical in early December, and the MD did a breast exam but didn't find anything that concerned him. Well, the pain has persisted, and about a week ago I found a lump and noticed some discoloration in that area. I went for another breast exam on Tuesday and the NP corroborated my findings. She also pointed out another area of greater density in that breast, which I hadn't even noticed. She said she'd send in a referral as a ""rush request"" so that I ""didn't have to worry for too long,"" and it's hard to say if she was just trying to make me feel better.

The past couple days the discoloration, which looks like a light bruise (but isn't), seems to have gotten worse. It's a couple inches in diameter as of this morning and is right above one of the lumps. I called the doctor's office yesterday since I hadn't yet heard back about the referral, and after waiting on hold for over half an hour I got an appointment for a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, and an ultrasound if needed, on Tuesday morning.

I know there are a lot of other things this could be, and breast cancer isn't usually painful, but the discoloration is worrying me the most. Are there other things that can cause discoloration AND a lump? Do cysts ever do that? Also, I was told that the radiologist will review my results with me on Tuesday. How much can I expect them to know from a mammogram and ultrasound? 

I'm trying to stay off Google and distract myself, but I am a chronic overthinker. Plus if you always expect the worst, you'll never be disappointed, right? This seems like a supportive community, and I appreciate any personal experience you can share. Hopefully I won't be spending much time in this sub in the future, but we'll see ❤️"

sleepygirl2019,1552654937,"Hi everyone,

Please hear me out...I just found a second lump on one of my breasts and I’m freaking out a little...I found my first lump almost 5 years ago and it was found to be benign. My doctor told me that I didn’t have to make yearly checkups anymore until I’m 40 or unless I find a new one or if it’s gotten bigger.

Well I randomly decided to check today and I found a second one. And what worried me is that I’ve also been coughing phlegm for months now. I don’t have a cold or anything, I feel perfectly normal. But whenever I cough, it’s not a “normal cough” it’s usually like I’m coughing out phlegm; no blood though.

I freaked myself out by putting these two together and googled it. I’m not really sure what to think? I have a general doctor checkup in a couple weeks, I know I can share with him there, but idk two weeks is a long time to wait to get a peace of mind. Should I be worried? I have not noticed any discharge either, or any serious pain in my breasts. But I also lost 15 pounds in the past year. My eating habits did not exactly change, but I did start working at Target doing the online orders. So I am constantly doing a lot of walking and moving around (more than the average Target employee). So at first I thought maybe that’s why I lost so much weight, but now I’m putting all these three together and it’s freaking me out :( I’d appreciate any input."

I have pretty thick hair so there was a carpet of it in the tub.

cherieblosum,1552603889,"Hey all,

Today my mom shared with me my extensive family history of breast and ovarian cancer. I'm almost 30 and she never mentioned it before. Basically, every woman on my dads side of the family for at least 3 generations had either breast or ovarian cancer. Most were diagnosed in their late 30s or early 40s. There were several that died from cancer. I'm estranged from my dads side of the family which is why I was not aware of this before. 

I'm feeling very worried. I actually had problems with my breasts my whole life, and wondered if I was at increased risk for breast cancer before knowing all this. 

I'm feeling very anxious and like it's inevitable that something bad is going to happen to me soon. I havent made an appointment with a doctor yet but I plan to.

Just looking for support from other young women who've been through this as well."
angryreceptionist,1552527618,"Hi - first time poster here. I’m 32, and have a family history of BC (both grandmothers, two aunts on my mothers side). 

For the past two months, I’ve had a strange, sometimes-stabby sometimes-dull pain in the top part of both of my breasts. At first I thought it was due to hormonal changes, but the pain has been semi-constant throughout My menstrual cycle. No lumps, though. 

Additionally, my breasts have been (for lack of a better word) - changing direction? My right boob seems to be facing more “upwards” lately...

Also I’ve been noticing a weird dimpling with my nipples...

I’ve made an appointment with my GP next week. I know that for a woman at my age, the risk is low - and it can be so, so many other things - 

But god damn it I’m scared. 

Am I being weird? Or irrational? Or crazy?

I have no family history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer yes, leukemia yes, but no other cancers. I was pretty sure I'm too young for this. Either way I made an appointment. My doctor was amazing, I don't have one so I went to my schools. She listened to me, did an exam and confirmed what I had. She asked my I thought and I straight away said probably cyst. She told me I was probably right but she was going to refer me to a breast cancer clinic and have an ultrasound. 

Ultra sound came back BIRADS 2 - most likely Fibroadenoma. She asked if I felt like I needed a biopsy and I said no I trust her judgement and the ultrasound tech. Although the ultrasound tech did give me a scare with her facial expressions. 

She told me to come back in 6 months, then 1 year after that. Well it's been 2 and a half and I'm heading back. For the last month I've been getting sharp pain in the same location, only my one boob, and I can't wear a proper bra without it bruising the area, or lay on my side/belly.

Is it true? Im very anxious right now and any insight would be deeply appreciated.

adriafl,1552436826,"In late January, I noticed a small red mark on my breast, close to my nipple. After about a week or two, the mark went from a red color to a light brown color, like the color of a scar or a freckle. It hasn’t gone away since then and hasn’t faded. I went to the doctor recently and they told me it’s nothing and that it’s probably a scar left from some trauma. I can’t help but worry since it’s been there for so long. I’m worried that the doctor just brushed me off. I’m only 19 years old. I have always had health anxiety. I have no other pain or itchiness or redness. Any chance this could be anything? "

The pain is in one area and it’s gotten to the point where I can’t wear a bra or lay on that side anymore. I’ve gone for an ultrasound and it came up empty. Not even a cyst.

uhpinion11,1551997800,"I found a lump in my right breast in December 2014. An ultrasound told the radiologists it was a fibroadenoma and that was that.  I was 24, there isn’t much history of breast cancer in my family so my doctor didn’t even really monitor the lump. 

Fast forward to late 2017, my lil lump has grown significantly and I get stabbing pains. I finally bring it up to my doctor after minimizing for a while and I spend early 2018 going through the cycle of ultrasound/ biopsy and then lumpectomy.  Lumpectomy was recommended to make sure it wasn’t a phyllodes tumour rather than a fibroadenoma.  Pathology prior to the surgery indicated no malignancy or atypical features but given the size (4.4mm x 3.3mm x 4.2 mm) best to remove. That happened late July 2018.  

Pathology on the whole lump came back and it was,  according to them, in fact a benign phyllodes tumour.  Surgeon hadn’t taken a margin at all, and pathology report mentioned the margin abutted the dyed resection line, but they didn’t seem overly concerned so I decided to forgo more surgery at that time and instead wait and see.

This Monday afternoon I had a follow up ultrasound.  The technician took only 2 ‘pictures’ and said something about going to check with the radiologist.  I didn’t really hear/ understand what she said she was checking. She leaves me alone in the room and heads out for what feels like a long time.  When she comes back she mumbled something about not needing anything else but was acting odd.  Again, I didn’t really hear what she said. She also asked me when my follow up was and then responded something like ‘oh good’ when I said it was in 10 days. Overall it was a weird and uncomfortable exchange that gave me just the worst vibes. 

Typing this out I see I’m probably just in a medical anxiety spiral.  At the same time, only two images seems BAD given my previous experience with ultrasound, and suggests to me there was something obviously concerning in that second picture.  I also fully look at the screen during ultrasounds and I am not a radiologist but it didn’t look good.

Does anyone else have follow up ultrasound experiences they could share to either reassure me or validate my anxiety? 

Its all going to be, whatever happens in my boob. "

uoc_cancer_research,1551958080,"Hi everyone,

We are still looking for people to take part in our research study at the University of Chester, UK, on daily functioning and psychological wellbeing in cancer patients.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and all that comes after this can often be a distressing, worrying and confusing time. Our aim is to investigate how cancer has affected your daily functioning and emotional wellbeing. We are particularly interested in how this then affects decisions you make about your treatment. Our goal is to help others that might find themselves in your position in the future. To do this, we need your help.

Anyone who is over 16 years of age and been diagnosed with any type of cancer can take part. Unfortunately, this study isn't suitable for cancer survivors who finished their treatment in the past. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that will take around 30 minutes to complete. You will be also asked whether you would like to participate in a phone or Skype interview at a later date, but you don’t have to agree to this to take part in the questionnaire study. While we hope that taking part will be a positive experience for you, we also understand that answering questions about your illness may be upsetting. You can always stop the questionnaire at any time. All your answers and data will be anonymous.

So my cancer was triple positive. I have no family history, didn't have the gene, and was only 27 at diagnosis. 

For me, the triple positive was very interesting cause to me that meant my cancer was completely hormonal based and joke's on me.. I had been taking birth control for nearly 10 years at that point. I obviously immediately halted the birth control after diagnosis and cannot take anything hormonal based for the rest of my life.

My oncologist can't legally agree with me but she did hint that it was an interesting theory that this was all birth control's fault. So out of curiosity, how many of you were on any type of birth control? I think the number of young diagnoses, especially on here, is pretty interesting...."

troubled21yo,1551684813,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub so pls bear with me or direct me to the appropriate sub. I am just really desperate now and scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

The right side hurts a lot. It always hurts more than the left side and it doesn't look/feel normal, especially when I touch it. It's not as bouncy as the one in the left side and sometimes the nip inverted, which I am ashamed of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so context first. When I was 18, I saw an oncologist w/ my mom and told the doc my symptoms. She instantly dismissed me and told my mom that I'm probably just overthinking(that the pain is most likely caused by my growing boobs bcs I was still a teenager, a late bloomer at that cus I had my first period only at 13). So I just continued my life, told myself I wasn't sick. But deep inside I knew something's wrong. 

Growing up with siblings who I shared a bed with in my adolescent years (4th-6th grade), someone would always accidentally step on my boobs bcs my sibs would wrestle on the bed. I'm so convinced that that could be the reason why my right boob looks dead now, like it probably didn't grow the way it should bcs it would always accidentally be hit/stepped on/. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the symptoms. Like I said, it constantly hurts. I try to feel it and the upper part(3 inches below my collarbone) and it is hard. Like there's something hard inside, but it's not a lump. I compare it with my left side which is a lot less harder(feels really normal). Another symptom: Sometimes it also hurts a little below my right underarm, the space beside my right boob that touches my tricep when my arms aren't spread out. I Googled it and learned that it might be the lymph nodes that are being affected by a tumor(?) and/or cancer cells in my right boob. These days it also hurts below my right boob and it's maddening bcs I don't know any other reason which I might be causing it. Lastly, every time I lie down, I really feel something heavy and hard in my right boob. Do I have a breast cancer? Bcs if I do, I think it's in Stage 4 already.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning to see an oncologist soon, probably in secret bcs, unfortunately every time I tell my mom I wanna see a doc again bcs of this reason, she tells me it's so unlikely and I'm just overthinking it. Has anyone here had a similar experience? I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you everyone &lt;3

deepwat3r,1551402561,"Hello everyone,  I'm here in hopes of getting some perspectives and advice on how to support my wife get through stage 4 breast cancer.  I know there are lots of great resources online, and I'm reading them, but right now I just feel like I need to put our story out there.  Just the act of writing this feels like it helps.

She was four years into remissions when we met &amp; started dating.  She told me about it early in our relationship, and like any guy in love would do, I said ""It's ok, if something happens we'll deal with it together.""  I meant it at the time, and I still mean it now.  It's safe to say though, that I didn't *really* understand what fighting cancer was like.

They found a new lump in her lymph node, near the original site, about we'd been together about a year.  I'd already bought a ring, picked a spot for the proposal etc.  After the biopsy came back she tried several times to break up with me, but I wasn't having it.  I gave her some space to process, and then a few weeks later we were engaged.

It's been almost two years since then.  In that time I've tried to learn how to live three months at a time, PET scan to PET scan.  We've progressed through two different phalanx of estrogen blockers, a second opinion, and the disappointment of an ineffective last-ditch surgery to remove additional lymph nodes.  A couple mets have popped up, but small and so far in ""non-critical"" areas, hip bone and liver.  Currently she's doing an oral chemo that thus far doesn't seem to be effective.  If the scan coming up in two weeks isn't good, next step will be drip chemo.  The oncologist claims even in that case ""you guys can still go on your April honeymoon.""

And this brings me to the real reason I'm here.

So far I've managed to compartmentalize my feelings, keep the brave face on, but DAMN it's getting hard.  My wife has told me that the best thing I can do for her is to ""be normal"" and ""not freak out"" I feel like that's left me with no real outlet other than one particular friend to whom I can vent.  Another frustration is that, due to having managed her own treatment for years before meeting me, my wife isn't as transparent with me as I would like.  I have to ask frequently to get details like oncology appointment dates, blood test results etc.  I've asked that she tell me as soon as she gets them, but it still doesn't happen.  I understand why she doesn't want to give me bad news, but it contributes to me feeling like a *passenger*.  Which I guess, being the one who *doesn't* have cancer, I ultimately am.  

So a couple questions -

I'm assuming there are support groups online for spouses like myself, any recommendations?  I have a family therapist, but a limited budget, so can't see her very often.

Re: the passenger feeling... should I just keep my mouth shut?  I get the details when I ask, and I go to the appointments when I get enough notice.  I've no wish to start a fight about it, and I know she means well.  I guess maybe I just answered my own question...

My mother has breast cancer for a long time... And that worries me a lot. I regrettably got breast implants at a young age. And I've been having issues and pain for a long time on one of my breast. I finally went to the hospital, but for now, the doctors have only done ultrasounds and next week I will have an MRI to see what's wrong with my breast...

I have insisted to the doctors that even if things are fine, I really would like to have my breast implants and natural breast removed... They have accepted this because of the cancer in my family and soon, hopefully, I will be going through this...

The thing is that I am only 25 and I am recently married. Maybe I was being too idealistic and thought that my husband would be ok with my decision, that he would value my health over looks. But after the appointment and him seeing that I am serious about this, he has told me that he wouldn't find me attractive with out breast implants...

And I am starting to have second thoughts... I value my marriage and my husband but I also value my health. And of course, there is also some vanity behind it, I keep trying to imagine life with out any breast at all, throwing away my bras and all, and in some way I feel liberated! No more silicone inside! No more worries! But on another side, I feel a bit scared of how it'd be a big blow my already low self-esteem and possibly my marriage...

I know there is a chance it can be nothing, but my sister expected them to tell her that...so I am hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.

I have always tended to keep things to myself, way more than I should. I am single so dont have a SO to talk to about it...and the guy I am seeing I am taking to the airport for his month long trip the day before and I don't want to burden him either. 

Is it wrong of me for not telling those close to me because I do not want to scare them since we just went through this? Or is it better that I don't freak them out until I know if there is a reason for them to freak out? "

But she did send me to get a mammogram, which I had today. I had a mammogram and ultrasound today, after which the doctor informed me that he wasn’t able to determine what the mass is, but that something to do with the edges of the mass led him to think it could possibly be cancerous. He said it was really 50/50 and that I need to have a biopsy done to be sure. My biopsy is tomorrow morning at 9am. I’m terrified. I’m nauseous. I’m exhausted but I can’t sleep.

I would simply feel more at ease if I know how best to handle the situation, including anything you think might be helpful, as that in and of itself will calm me greatly until my appointment on Wednesday. 

35/F, experiencing some minor discomfort in my right breast for little more than 6 weeks. Thought I'd felt something 4 weeks ago, but could not locate it again thereafter. This morning I've located one fairly hard, immovable pea-to-nickel- sized lump located fairly close to the sternum, but still situated in the breast.

 Also present: Potential other distinct lumps adjacent (these, though also hard, seem they *could* be more of an anomaly of anatomy on this side, or swollen ducts?)

 - No history of Breast Cancer in Family history. 

 - 0 children, 0 pregnancies

 - Have piercings, and have noticed slightly ""off"" discharge on this side for 6-8 weeks. 

 - No real visible changes to breast.

 - No weight loss, but on and off experiencing night sweats

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I'm a realist, but that's a double-edged sword... I'm calm yet feel anxiety creeping in, and. I do not want it to get in the way of a clear head during my appointment. Having a few pointers regarding this step would go a long way in soothing said anxiousness."

boolehealth,1551077736," 

In **July 2015**, when Sarah had just turned **42**, she felt a lump in her right breast. She thought it was just benign, similar to lumps that her mother and aunt developed around her age. However, when she consulted her doctor, she was advised to get tested. Both her **mammogram and ultrasounds** came out to be normal. Sarah still felt that there was something wrong with her. However, it eventually proved to be quite a difficult task to convince her doctor to conduct a **biopsy**.

After convincing her doctor to do the test, Sarah was diagnosed with bony metastasis and visceral metastasis to lung and liver, and she was already at **Stage 4**.

At first, Sarah had to undergo a **bilateral mastectomy**, which was later accompanied with all sorts of complications including an MRSA infection. Sarah had 4 cycles of ***Taxotere*** and ***Cytoxan***.

Sarah suffered from skin rashes and high fever, after her chemotherapy. Since her liver enzymes were at an elevated level, her chemotherapy got delayed. Moreover, her **alk phos** was **801** and **ALT/AST** was **5–6 times** normal.

Unfortunately, cancer did not respond to chemotherapy and it failed to shrink or regress. Then Sarah was started on **hormone therapy** with ***Letrozole***, but it resulted in her cholesterol levels increasing dramatically (e.g., **LDL 220** and then **290**).

In **August 2017**, the radiologist identified enlarging intrathoracic lymph nodes. Her doctor recommended **bronchoscopy** with biopsy of a lymph node, and the pathology report came back as **metastatic breast cancer**, still 100% ER+, 20% PR+, **Her2 negative**. The treatment with ***Letrozole*** was continued for almost **2 years**.

As a result, ***Letrozole*** was discontinued and she was put on ***Faslodex*** and ***Ibrance***. Since Sarah was already suffering from osteoporosis, therefore, the doctor started ***Xgeva***. Sarah was given ***Xgeva***, as an injection under the skin, after every **four weeks** but it made her feel miserable for several days. The most side effects that Sarah experienced after having ***Xgeva*** shots **were jaw pain, shortness of breath and unusual muscle or bone pain.**

Within **3 months**, the only cancer evident on CT scans was an 8 mm lesion in her thoracic spine. Sarah was able to stay on the highest dose of ***Ibrance*** for about **11 months**. Scans remained stable and her liver function tests also returned to normal. Even **transaminases** normalized after **3 months**. Her **alk phos** levels also dropped to 128 after two months and they continued to show a considerable decrease over the next **two months**. ***Faslodex***, ***Ibrance*** and***Xgeva*** were continued for more than a year.

The doctor told Sarah that the hot flashes and menopausal-like symptoms were due to hormone therapy (***Letrozole*** followed by ***Faslodex***). Although, Sarah had shown great progress with ***Ibrance***, she experienced some side effects as well. These side effects included some **hair thinning, fever and mild fatigue**.

Moreover, it was observed that **both her platelet counts and white blood cell counts (especially neutrophils) had lowered**. ***Ibrance*** also elevated liver enzymes. Sarah managed to stay on ***Ibrance*** for **11 months** and avoided bone marrow toxicity. She had a reduced dose of ***Ibrance*** 100 mg.

Her isoenzymes were elevated for liver, bone, and intestine in **2015**, but after treatment with ***Letrozole, Ibrance, Faslodex and Xgeva***, there was a tremendous decrease in her isoenzymes levels in **2018**. Sarah is really happy now to have a normal alk phos and she is even hopeful that the normal value means her bone disease is stable and dormant.

Apart from the aggressive cancer treatment, Sarah was also prescribed to have a healthy and balanced diet, with **fruits and vegetables and yogurt**. The diet itself made Sarah feel a whole lot better.

The entire experience of going through the treatment was really difficult not only for her but also for her entire family. Sometimes, she would be really depressed and on some days the pain would be unbearable. But she had her family by her side to support her emotionally.

WeHaveNeverMetBefore,1551061729,"Im not sure if this is the right place for my question since i have not been diagnosed with breast cancer. I just have some symptoms that I'm curious about. 

Im 33, female. My grandma on my dads side had breast cancer. My mom had stomach cancer. Thats the only cancers that I'm aware of in my family. 

A couple months ago after a shower i happened to notice that my left breast looked smaller than normal. It wasnt noticably smaller than the right but all my life left has been ever so slightly larger. 
As of today i feel like it is drastically smaller. Atleast a cup size smaller than the other side. I can even tell there is a size difference with tshirt on now.  No redness or dimpling or anything. It feels different though. Like it seems denser. Not as fatty as the right but still as heavy.

Every few months i do self check and i noticed last night that when raising my arm or leaning forward left nipple pulls in slightly. It doesnt fully retract but the top pulls in so its more angled upward, i guess? 

I have also been gettinf this strange like cold burning sensation in left breast only. Its kind of like a tingly electric feeling. It doesnt hurt. It just feels odd. Has been happening more the last couple of weeks. 

The last symptom i noticed last night was the inner part of left breast had a number of lumps scattered throughout. It was only on the inner side and only on left breast. 

I know its likelt to be something other than cancer but the posibility still worries me. I don't currently have health insurance. I havent even been able to ask my boyfriend if he has noticed the diff in size. He has a good friend who, about 6 months ago, found out her breast cancer was back and had spread. He took the news hard. I dont want to approach him with my symptoms and make him worry just for it to be nothing in the end, ya know? 

Should i be worried? Is it something i can put off until i get insurance? What are some other possibilities other than cancer?"

what will happen at the doctors appointment? will they send me to a dermatologist for the rash? also any advice or insight is appreciated. "
raleighsabrina,1550894461,"Just diagnosed with low risk DCIS.  Thinking of active monitoring only.  Anyone else forgo lumpectomy, hormone therapy etc?"
Darkside_Morticia,1550876036,"38 years old &amp; I have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, ER &amp; PR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. My tumor was 6cm and have 1 lymph node involved.

Because of the size of my tumor it was recommended to do chemo first for my treatment plan. I started chemo in November and I have three more treatments to go. Next will be my surgery.

My cancer has responded very well to the chemo and hand exams by my doctor have shown that the tumor has shrunk to almost undetectable by touch alone. I am a candidate for a lumpectomy but the surgeon has made it very clear that due to the location of the tumor and surrounding tissue he would need to take that my breast with most certainly collapse and that radiation could also possibly shrink it and make it even more deformed. I have therefore decided to go with a double mastectomy and reconstruction.

I have been very anti-radiation from the beginning. However, if I was going to have just the lumpectomy, I was planning on doing it because it’s the best choice to make sure all that cancer is killed. Now that I’ve decided for a double mastectomy, I don’t feel the same way. A lot of the studies of the benefits of radiation with a mastectomy are women who are having the surgery first then possibly chemo and then radiation. There is not a lot of data yet for women in my case who are having the chemo first and the chemo is doing the excellent job of shrinking the tumor &amp; killing all the cancer before surgery.

I obviously want to make the best choice for my health and non-reoccurrence. However I’m not finding a lot of back up where the benefit outweighs the risk of the radiation.

Anyone out there that had mastectomy and refused recommended radiation? Are you happy with the decision? Do some of you regret that decision?"

I’m 26. I was wondering if anyone else has advice or experience with this. My mom was diagnosed at 41, she had DCIS and a masectomy. Her mom was diagnosed at 46 and passed on eventually. I believe in her 50s. 

What other preventatives can I do? My GYN also told me to join a breast cancer clinic as well.

I do have a ~slight~ variant of unknown significance  in the BRCA1 ( C1146G) gene and CHEK2 (470T&gt;C) gene. She told me they aren’t sure entirely what this means and as gene testing and research continues, they may know more.

aaronpppppp,1550712925,"Hi - sorry for the long questions.  I appreciate any info at all you want to share, thank you all.  

All secondhand so sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.  My friend was diagnosed with metastatic rapid spread breast cancer, a lump the size of maybe a plum and also cancer in her jawbone - she ignored pain for a long time.  She's was doing chemo and radiation on jaw, and now just chemo for the last few months which is was precursor to breast removal and I believe some chest muscle.  That was about 6 months ago.  The latest scans now came back with cancer on liver, chest wall/lungs and spine and doctors will be introducing a new chemo drug for a monthly treatment.

So I've read about life expectancy for this scenario to be  something around 20% over 5 years, and that this diagnosis means basically a life time of checkups, relapses, treatment, set backs, etc.  I understand this and also never waver in being positive with her in that she will beat this.    She never wants to ask prognosis questions with her DRs and I never share what I read even though she understands how serious it is.  I never attend visits with DRs. This is info I will never share with her unless she asks.   I know it's not a fair question of you and guesswork.  But what I am  asking is in your experience in what you went through or your family did, how bad is it honestly with that second cancer discovery with spine, liver and lungs/chest.  That sounds extremely bad to me. Please share anything you can and sorry if I brought up painful memories.  Thank you "
lunaboro,1550711959,"So, my mother has breast cancer at around age40/42. She had DCIS so she got a double masectomy! Been fine since.

Her mother died from breast cancer in 1989. I believe she was 50/55.

I get my gene test results. On Friday. Mine will be negative! I know it. 

My mom has never taken it, so she doesn’t know if she carries the gene.

Since she had breast cancer so young, would you say she most likely has the gene then? She never had it done so I’m wondering this based for her own health. I would think she would if she had it so young, no?"

catladygetsfit,1550702066,"Hi everyone! This isnt regarding me, but my mom. When she was 48 (I would've been around 11 at the time), my mom was diagnosed with ductal cell carcinoma in situ. She underwent a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, no chemotherapy. She was cancer free for almost 17 years, but this last month she had a mammogram showing one small lump (from her pathology reports, she says its about 0.6mm) and another calcification (unsure on size or anything related to that), and we found out yesterday they are both cancer. She has an appointment next week with the surgeon who did her original lumpectomy, but naturally we're all a little impatient, so I'm wondering if anyone here has any experience with this sort of thing. For the record, I am a registered nurse (I work in a post-op heart/lung/transplant surgery unit though, so my oncology experience is limited) so I will understand most medical jargon you throw around. A few questions:

How likely is it that she will have a mastectomy versus another lumpectomy (cancer is on the same breast, in a different area)?

Would they do radiation again, or will she have to go the chemotherapy route?

Her pathology report stated something about being both estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, which from what I read indicates targeted hormonal therapy can be used. Is this considered chemotherapy?

Does her chemotherapy have to be intravenous (and does that require she get an implanted port?)? Is it ever strictly pill form? (Side note: my mom is very anti chemotherapy after she saw how sick my dad got from chemo for his multiple myeloma (go figure this is happening to our family AGAIN) - so any insight as to how bad or easy your chemo was would be appreciated, I'm hoping to convince her otherwise.)

I'm assuming we won't know more until her actual surgery (be is mastectomy or lumpectomy, but I'm guessing the former). I would assume at that time they would do a lymph node biopsy? If the lymph nodes are positive, what does that mean? Definite metastasis or just possible? Would she then need a full body PET scan? Despite being a nurse I have very limited understanding of oncology.

Thank you so much for reading and for any replies!"

doeatmypoop,1550656632,"Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone here had these symptoms before they found out they had breast cancer? 

My mom has been fighting breast cancer for a long time and I am a bit worried because I feel weird on my left breast. 

That breast has felt weird for about two years, I always had sharp pain that came and went out nowhere. But since December that the pain has been getting worse. Now I feel a burning sensation on it all the time and when the sharp pain comes it’s a lot stronger than it was before.
The burning sensation has also moved on the upper, left side of my back (right behind my breast). And since a few days a red mark appeared on the breast...

I have tried to find all kinds of excuses for this for a long time, because I am afraid of cancer. I have seen how it has destroyed my mothers life... 

But I finally decided to go a doctor and I had waited for a month for that appointment and when I told her about what was going on, she didn’t even see my breast. She didn’t even touch me. Nothing. She stood up like a meter away from me and looked at me as if I was crazy :( and then the only thing she said was that I needed to go to a gynecologist for that problem...

But here in my city is impossible to find an appointment in a gynecologist. They don’t want to take any new patients and I have insisted and called all of them, but they don’t want to take me or tell me to call again in a couple of months, haha. And the appointments then (if they even want to be give me one) are months away... 

I am sorry to complain, I just want to know if I am just overthinking this, has anyone also had the burning sensation/sharp pain/marks on the skin of the breast?... "

My mom was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer in her right breast in April 2017. The doctors told her it was borderline stage two because the tumor was starting to open or had opened a little, but it didn't move beyond that. She had a lumpectomy in May 2017 and the doctors were very positive they removed the entire tumor. She has had other tests that came back supporting that they successfully removed all of the tumor and that cancer did not spread. She had radiation treatment and chemotherapy and is taking a medication that she is supposed to take for 10 years or more? She finished chemo in July 2018 (about a year or a little over a year of chemo) and has had follow up tests that came back clear (no cancer). She recently was diagnosed with pneumonia, which she needed to take a second round of antibiotics to treat. She was told she must have had it for a while due to the first round providing little improvement. She finished the antibiotics and has been feeling a little better. She had a follow up chest X-Ray today and they found a mass on her lung, same side she had breast cancer. They are concerned this mass is cancerous and she was sent for a CT scan. She has an appointment at the cancer center Thursday. 
Right now I am terrified for my mom. She just got done with treatment, was told she was clear and everything looked good. Then this happens. I know it does no good worrying about it too much now because we don’t have straight answers yet, but the possibility that her breast cancer has spread to her lungs is hard to not think about. I’m going with her Thursday to support her and to better understand things. What are the chances it’s something benign and not cancerous? And are they always going to be concerned a “mass” is cancerous because of her history? I would assume yes, but if so are they always going to think “cancer” or say “it could be cancerous, but it’s most likely nothing. We’ll check anyway”. It sounds like they didn’t give her any reassurances. Two doctors came in, which was unusual from other appointments she has had, and told her they found a mass on her lung and they are concerned it’s cancerous, more tests are needed, appointment for cancer center, that’s it. I came here to find out if anyone else has been through this and for any advice, knowledge, experience, support, etc moving forward, if it is the worst case scenario (BC has come back and is now met). If you have read this far, thanks, I just don’t know what to do right now."

hahlisa,1550593226,"Hey everyone,

I do not have breast cancer but I didn’t know a better place to ask this.
About a year ago now I had a non cancerous tumor removed (it grew twice it’s size within half a year aka why it was removed). 
The surgery went well and I have a scar along half of my nipple from it.

I’ve been having a lot of pain, weird sensations and a feeling like blood is running out of it when it’s not lately. It’s probably nothing but I was wondering if any people who had breast surgery have had similar experiences.
"
mrsdennistein,1550592440,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with Grade 3, stage 2 triple negative breast cancer in May of 2018. My lump was 11mm after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (FEC-T protocol) with lymph node involvement. On the scans it looked as though one or possibly two lymph nodes had micrometastases, but during surgery, my surgeon ended up removing 8 lymph nodes from the left axilla, on top of a left-sided mastectomy.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to stop my chemo two sessions early as I had a nasty reaction to docetaxel - basically, it caused a massive insult to my liver, and I ended up in hospital for 8-9 days dealing with the effects. After a short recovery time, surgery was next, which was surprisingly easy to recover from - at least, physically. 

&amp;#x200B;

I delayed reconstruction as at the time, I'd had more than enough of people poking and prodding at me, and had developed a phobia of medical settings. Also, with a punishing month-long course of high-dose radiation to wade through, and having read how that can sometimes affect the success of reconstruction, I thought it wiser to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now waiting on my referral letter to come through to discuss the various types of reconstruction available, and at a point now where I'm...looking forward (?) to having my cosmetic appearance altered. It's a harsh reminder when you're missing a breast, and it has affected my confidence. I get a bit of discomfort when wearing a bra along my ribcage on left side, where the surgery took place. Touch wood, I have no lymphoedema or cording, and the site healed very tidily. I'm so thankful to the surgeon who performed my operation; he was confident that he'd got it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I worry a lot about recurrence and I wonder if any other triple negative survivors out there can offer me some words of comfort and wisdom. You don't read as many experiences with this type of cancer as it's not common, and the fact that it disproportionately affects younger women brings its own challenges. For my own part, if anyone else has been diagnosed with the same, I can weigh in with my experiences of treatment if it's of any use.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping we could get a little support group going here, swap stories, and just generally be there for one another. I am still learning to cope with worry in a healthy way, and I'm not always successful, but each day, it gets a little easier to reconcile the events of last year. Life after cancer is not the same - but it's life, and for that I am very grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and hugs to everyone &lt;3

Im 24 and was diagnosed with a nonspecific breast lump after biopsy. Is there such thing as breast lump with no specific features? I thought it always fall into one of the categories?

Halleaon,1550510119,"So, when I was 12 my mother was diagnosed at age 46 with inflammatory breast cancer. Her lymph nodes had swollen and she assumed she'd been bitten by a spider and had gone into the doctor when they didn't go back to normal. 2 years later after a double mastectomy, and chemo she died at stage 4. Since then every female in our family has tested BRCA 1 &amp; 2 positive and several of my nieces have gotten preemptive double mastectomies. My uncle also had brain cancer (also died), my grandmother had bone cancer (also died-all on the same side of the family) so the risk in our family is pretty high, something we are well aware of. Well, recently I suffered a very strange and very painful type of headache that had two possible diagnosis: Occipital nueralgia or meningitus (per urgent care) they referred me to my doctor, upon visiting my doctor it was found I had a fever of 100.9 (per my doctor: probably meningitus, was advised to keep an eyes on my temperature and go into the emergency room if it gets worse (it luckily went down). I now have a neurologist appointment on Thursday to verify.) Well, I happened to mention while I was there that I had recently found a lump on one of my breasts and thought maybe it was a cyst, so an exam was done on the spot and indeed, i have a lump about the size of a pea, it dos not squish (hard), it does not move (fixed), and it's not a super definable shape and it is now ever so slightly larger than it was when I first found it. He referred me to a radiologist for imaging and I was scheduled to go in within 4 days. Today is that day. I am 35 years old and terrified of what might be found. I haven't told any of my family yet just in case it's nothing because I don't want to worry them. I am doing my best at the moment to try not to worry until I have test results but I usually have pretty high anxiety so can't say I'm doing great at it."
Jessica_Maya1,1550486066," 

This rare and aggressive sort of breasts cancer is known as inflammatory breast cancer in light of the fact that the Inflammatory breast cancer symptoms commonly looks swollen, red, or aggravated.

Inflammatory breast cancer growth will, in general, be analyzed at more youthful ages than different kinds of breasts disease. It represents only 1 to 5 of all breasts tumours analyzed in the United States.

#  Inflammatory Breast Cancer Symptoms

&amp;#x200B;

As a rule of inflammatory breast cancer, it is unimaginable to expect to feel a strong tumour amid a physical examination.

When somebody has inflammatory breasts disease, the bad cells obstruct the lymph vessels in the skin of the influenced breast. This implies lymph liquid, in which white platelets are transported, can’t stream typically through the [breasts tissue](https://www.medfaw.com/inflammatory-breast-cancer-symptoms.html)."
astorkha,1550464316,"Hi, everyone

 Just turned 26 on the 8th and I discovered a knot on my left breast with a rash like mark underneath last year before moving. Just a couple weeks ago, I discovered the same type of knot in my right breast. Within a few days of discovering the knot, my breasts have swollen back to my old bra size which was a D and I went to a C from a severe eating disorder I teetered with. Not sure if they're swollen from eating consistently again but I have been EXTREMELY luggish. No energy like I once had. It was always said that I had too much energy to sit down with. Now, I can barely make it outside. And it's not just occasionally, it's everyday now.

My mom told me my aunt on my dad's side died of BC in her 50's and she was diagnosed just a year/two before that!!!! What are the chances she had it long before then and never knew? 

I went to a local clinic that would be more financially forgiving. It's a high up front cost and I do not have insurance. A lovely Redditor I spoke with suggested I start a GoFund Me but I haven't told anyone this news.... not everyone at least and I know with a GoFund Me, it helps to share with FB. I'd rather know I have it than not know and find out and have to tell everyone it's not and get funding for nothing. I'm realistic and a bit stubborn but I'm almost positive at this point something is not right.  

I've researched all my other diagnoses before being officially diagnosed: PCOS, hernia, back injury (side effects) . 

I have a knack for knowing things before they happen. 

So, I'm here to seek what others would do being in my situation? 

Thanks for reading and I greatly appreciate ANY advice. "

horticulturedeviant,1550451621,"I'm a new poster. I feel so horribly for what you're all going through. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. My story is about my gf who was recently diagnosed.

The day she was diagnosed, the doctor wanted to initiate surgery. 

A day or two later, she had a lumpectomy, lymphectomy, and a port put in for chemo.

The doctor said the lymphs came back clean and that the lump had clean margins, but yet they still want to do chemo and radiation. 

I brought up the idea of a second opinion the day she was diagnosed, but now she's recovering from surgery.

She's supposedly cancer-free, but they want to do chemo and radiation. Why does this all feel like doctors are still throwing dartboards at the wall?

My girlfriend doesn't have insurance and will be billing medicaid. How many aggressive treatment plans are designed to bill medicaid more than you ever could with insurance?

I'm skeptical and I want the best for my girlfriend, but this is all so fast and she hasn't had a second opinion.

Anyone have experience with false positives? I'm really scared for my girl and want to know how we should proceed. We've requested all her paperwork, her biopsy results and surgery results, and I just have this feeling we're going to find out that it wasn't cancer at all that they pulled out. Would the surgeon really tell us?

This may be all over the place, but any insight you can provide I'd really appreciate. "
thelastdaisymeadow,1550379382,"Okay to start off I’m an 18 year old female. I know breast cancer at my age is basically non existent but I’m just trying to find a place to talk about this. I’m scared shitless. I don’t have females to talk to about this in my life. About 2 months ago my breasts started being really sensitive, and I was massaging them to try and make it feel better and I noticed I had two very large hard lumps in both breasts I almost passed out. They’re both kind of behind the nipples. I’m a b cup so my breasts are very small, both lumps are VERY hard, and both about the size of the larger kind of gum balls. I’m not sure what else to compare it to. They’re so large I can feel them from any angle, through the nipple, through the side, top and bottom of my breast. Trying to move it around was so painful I had to stop. I’ve also had crust on both my nipples now too. It’s embarrassing I know. Every time I google it the only thing that pops up is breast feeding stuff. I have never had a baby and have never been pregnant or am pregnant now. My nipples are so painful I can’t rub them against anything without wincing, I can’t lay on my stomach or anything because of how uncomfortable the lumps are. They don’t necessarily hurt but just feel large and uncomfortable, they only hurt when I try to force it to move, the lumps will not move. I don’t believe I’m still in puberty because I got my period at 11. My grandma currently has breast cancer, my aunt had breast cancer , and both my other grandparents died from colon cancer and cervical cancer. Cancer runs in my family so bad, so I’m really nervous. Yesterday I even gave in and bought a pregnancy test just to double check, even though I knew I wasn’t pregnant and I’m not. Does anyone know what this could be? Or have any advice. I don’t have a doctor currently so I’m trying to find a new one who can see me soon but they all have waiting lists. Any advice or comments help but please don’t be rude or disrespectful. Thank you guys "
nighthaven,1550365876,"I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma this week and, after speaking with my Primary Care Physician, it is likely that I'll be looking at a double mastectomy as that is what he is pushing for.  I speak to a surgeon Tuesday the 19th but I've got several questions.  While I've seen several posts about just this issue, all of the answers are geared toward women but men DO get BC as well so I'm looking for some help as well as any kind of experiences shared by others who've gone through this...especially any men who have.

My questions are thus:
What should I be looking at as far as a recovery period?
How long will I have to be away from work?
What can I do make recovery easier?
Will I be able to sleep on my back or sides or would it be easier to sit and sleep?
Should I even bother with any kind of reconstruction since men don't have ""breasts"" in the regular sense anyway?
Will I have to take drugs if I have a double mastectomy?
How much pain will I be in and how much will my flexibility and/or versatility be affected when it comes to being able to reach for things or lifting things?

There are many other questions I likely have but they're all storming through my head so quickly that I can only get these ones out for now.

All emotions aside, I guess I'm looking more for post-surgical care and recovery advice.  Anything will be considered.

For the last six/seven months, I’ve noticed that my right nipple has red dots on it, like blisters, when it’s fully erect, but not when flat. Both of my nipples are extremely dry, and have been my entire adolescence. I’ve worried on and off about my nipple for the last few months, went to two (unhelpful) doctors in Ireland before I left, and last week paid and went to a gynecologist in Germany who also wasn’t worried, and gave me a cream for dermatitis, which so far has taken away the dryness, but hasn’t touched the redness. I’m having sleepless nights as I’ve read that if creams have no effect, it’s a bad sign. I’ve also been trying lanolin but I find that it sticking to my bra irritates my nipple more. There’s no itching, pain or discharge. I have constant skin allergies on my face, and as a baby I had severe eczema. I know the logical option would be to go to a dermatologist for a biopsy, but I’m scared of the costs as I’m not paid much. Truth be told, I wore the same bra for four months that was about two sizes too small, so I’m absolutely hoping that that could be the culprit and not anything sinister.

LinkTheHero1121,1549951303,"So a little bit of background. I'm a major health hypochondriac. Everything that I ever find wrong is cancer. It wasn't always this way. My step father died of Stage 4 lung cancer in 2016. That was the first time that anyone THAT close to me has died. I had to be the one to call the hospice care whenever he passed away.

But aside from that, I weigh about 230 and my boobs are at a size42DDD. So in October when my husband was home on leave (he's in the Navy) we went out for his birthday and one of my boobs were sore. It was weird. It didn't really hurt, but it was like, more annoying than anything? It only happened when I moved a VERY specific way. I could grab them, move them, jump, and whatever else and nothing but the disturbance would only happen like I said, when I moved a certain way. It went away and I thought nothing of it.   
Fast forward to December. It happened again. Now, I feel my boobs all the time (as does my husband since he's a boob guy) and we've never felt anything. One morning I was using the restroom and kept feeling until I THINK I found something. Now, I feel like half of what I'm ""feeling"" is my brain just putting together that I found something and alas, I think it's breast cancer.   
It's now the beginning of February and I went to visit my husband. I've been telling him about it and wanted to make sure that he could feel it. He told me that he couldn't feel anything that felt different from any other part of my boob, even when I pointed it out.   
I'm going to call tomorrow to make an appointment because my anxiety is bad and ISN'T going to shut the hell up until I go and I'm terrified of the doctors.

Now, can anyone tell me what they think?

Please take even a few moments to offer any experience you may have for me. For my mama. For our family who isn’t ready to lose the glue that keeps us together. 

I’m 32 years old in a week and I feel like a child, lost, and confused. I’m devastated and I could really use any help you can offer. 

Prayers in abundance please, for Tina, because cancer can have her, not MY mom!! "

triniaries,1549852388,"Hi,  
Sorry for the babbling post. It's been awhile. Let me say upfront that I have already mentioned my pain to my radiation oncologist and been told to ""monitor it"". This is late night panic and general inability to sleep because I'm convinced the cancer has spread to my spine. I just need another perspective right now and doctors god bless them aren't living with cancer in their bodies so I'm asking you guys for input if you'll bear with me.

Diagnosis: TNBC Stage 2 IDC

Treatment Plan: ACx4 Taxolx4 then Lx with SNP followed by 6 weeks of Rad then Capeticabine 

I am 3 weeks into radiation and have inexplicable dull pain in my middle back. It's been going on for nearly 2 weeks. I've tried stretching and acupuncture and nothing seems to help. It doesn't seem to be getting worse but aleve doesn't help and I'm telling myself it's the tabletop that I lie on every weekday for treatment but its the weekend and the pain persists.

Should I push for a scan? Does anyone else have any experience with this? Is this the kind of pain that I should be aware of when thinking about distant mets?

Thank you for reading. I hope anyone who reads this is doing well. xo"

creftdaggg,1549524782,are you allowed to post links to Facebook donations ? the charity option thing! my mom recently got diagnosed with breast cancer so am trying to support in any way possible. Thank you guys 
random1832,1549517806,"hi everyone, i’ve been worried about a lump in both my breasts that i noticed around 7 years ago (i’m now 17). 
i got it checked by a doctor then and he told me my breasts were just growing. i came back several months ago because it didn’t seem to get better over the years and he told me the same thing. 
my breasts do have an odd shape but it doesn’t look “unhealthy”, i’ve seen women with breasts the same shape. what worry me are the lumps, their texture and how big they are (they’re in a “spaceship” shape, taking up almost my whole breast and i can “move it around” with my fingers and actually pinch it and sort of hold it). 
it’s painful sometimes. 

what do you think? i trust my doctor but getting him to check it doesn’t relieve me because it doesn’t seem to be getting better. thanks in advance!

lisanycbc,1549292365,"I'm in my 40s, married with no children and am a staying home wife.  I just moved to east coast and during a check up mammogram they found something, then the biopsy came back with IDC and DCIS in one spot and atypical cells in another spot.  They want to do another biopsy on a 3rd spot since I can't do MRI with contrast dye.  

Anyways, IDC and DCIS spot seems to be small enough.  Will probably get lumpectomy soon on both breasts.  

IDC/DCIS are ER/PR positive, and HER2 negative.  

I expect at least radiation and hormone therapy after the surgery.  Don't know about chemo.

My question is if I'll be able to go through the surgery, recovery, then radiation, without much help.  My husband will be there but he won't be able to take care of me fully or go to radiation treatments with me.  

I also have not told my family and I'm thinking I don't want to tell them to avoid additional pain and suffering for them.  I already have a couple of chronic problems and my mom gets extremely worried easily.  I'm afraid giving her another bad news will affect her mental and physical health.  Her and I have gone through so much together.  

My mom would be the best person to take care of me, she knows exactly what I need to make me feel better even without me saying it. But it breaks my heart to see her suffering because of me.  I think it will be selfish to tell her.  I don't know what to do.  

I know I'm fortunate.  I think it was found early, it's smallish, my husband has a good insurance, and I don't even have to go to work during all this.  

But sometimes things like this keep piling on top of me and it's really hard to dig myself out of it.  

Anyways, how much help did you need during your surgery and treatment?  Can I get through it with minimal help?

StreetHawkGV,1548689705,"Hi Everyone. It's tough to think about but I am remaining strong for her and all that we will be going through over the next year or so. I figured I would post in here to share her story. 

It was late December when it all started. Getting ready for bed she was in the bathroom as I was doing the last of the dishes that night. All of a sudden I heard her call my name and she had a look of terror on her face and she told me to feel and yes that's when we found a lump.  Obviously trying to calm down the situation told her we will need to make a doctors appointment. They were able to get her in 2 days later. Though we really weren't prepared for all that was about to happen. It went from finding 1 lump to being ultrasound testing and then hearing there were 4 lumps. So they did a needly biopsy and well they cam back all cancerous. A few days later after that she was asked to come back into the doctors office and they did a check on her lymph nodes. The results of that were that the cancer had spread there to the right armpit.  So once again she broke down crying and I comforted her and we've just been trying to process all thats going on. Then came the doctor visit with a surgeon and he didn't sugar coat anything. He went with worst scenario and let her know he was recommending a double mastectomy, follow by 6 to 8 weeks of recovery and then most likely will be 20 weeks of chemo. After that they will then look into reconstruction if she does not need to do radiation in addition to the other treatments. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now we are currently waiting to find out when the surgery date will be. It's going to be beyond tough road ahead not to mention I work full time and have been dealing with getting my own cancer treatment over the past 10 months from when I was diagnosed in 2018. It's beyond horrible to figure out why this is all happening to us and especially her. My fiance is in Law Enforcement and she has worked so hard to achieve so many of her dreams. She's touched so many lives and selflessly done so much always putting others first. If I could take it away and have it only be me I would in a second cause she doesn't deserve to go through all this. It's as if our world is turned completely upside down and I am doing everything in my power to be there for her every second of every day and just try to make life better for her.  If you'd like to follow her story please do.

iluvcostco,1548571414,"Hi all,

My wife's case:
33yrs old, a lump near the surface of her breast; Ultrasound releaved 2cm size;
Screening mammogram was negative and releaved dense breast tissue;
Feels hard with smooth edges (imagine a BB gun pellet);

Timeline of events:
She felt a lump, 3 days later had a doctor feel by hand and they did an ultrasound on the spot, 3 weeks later did a screening mammogram (it was supposed to be an ultrasound + diagnostic mammogram but the radiology department messed up)

My concern/question:
She didn't do a diagnostic mammogram. My understanding is that's the one your supposed to do if there's a lump. Instead she did the screening mammogram, which came back negative. In this case, should she still do a diagnostic, or is the screening result conclusive enough?"

Pokyspider,1548466645,"Just thought I’d post a quick update for anyone about to have surgery. I live in japan (but I’m Irish) and I had a right breast mastectomy on Thursday morning. I don’t remember going under, just having a nice dream and then hearing the surgeons voices dropping in. I woke a bit confused as to why I couldn’t breath through my mouth and quite a bit of pain, but that was quickly brought under control. 
Surgery took 3.5 hours as they had to remove all of the lymph nodes under my arm (previously unexpected), and I had a rough night with little sleep, lots of checks every 15 mins, but the following day I was much better! I was hooked up to an IV, drains, heart monitor and catheter, but they had removed everything but the drains by lunchtime. 
Had some lunch, and water (at last)! And then they got me up for a stroll around the ward. 
The surgery site itself doesn’t look that bad at all, and I’m in pretty high spirits. The nurses got me to reach up the wall on a chart before surgery to see where I could reach and marked it - I guess that’s a goal for rehab later.
Anyway, although I wouldn’t want to repeat it, it wasn’t too bad and I’m feeling good. Lower arm is very stiff but I can raise it reasonably well but not above my shoulder. Rehab starting on Jan 30th. They keep you in for at least a week in Japan so I’m making myself comfortable. There’s a convenience store downstairs so no worries if I run out of snacks! I even have a fridge and hotplate in my room - it’s like a hotel! 
So that’s me for now. Settling in and feeling positive. 
Good luck to everyone with surgeries coming up. It’s not fun but it’s not that bad. You’ve got this.

SingleMaltLife,1548345487,"There are many many posts which are asking about a possible lump and getting checked. The obvious and correct answer is always going to be go to the doctor. 

Would it be possible to set up one of those auto replies with some basic info in it so that people who post get the info, even if people aren’t here to answer them straight away. We could gather together some of the best replies already given and put that info into the reply? I don’t want to discourage people from asking, rather ensure they all get the same info. I think mostly they want someone to talk to, but giving them reliable info might help too (especially in the US where going to get checked might mean a bill from the doctor, but there are other options). 

I’d suggest things like 

-age/sex does matter if you’re worried go to the doctor

-links to good websites out there with info, which describes symptoms, places to go get checked in us and U.K. 

-confirmation that the only good advice is to get it checked by a doctor. Only a doctor can give you 100% reassurance that your lump/redness/swelling/soreness is benign. 

-info on when people are likely to start regular screens and links to what to expect? 

-Also what to expect in a consultation if you go to get your boobs checked by a doctor. 

-just cause it can never be mentioned too much, some info on Pap smears too 

That was all off the top of my head and only a suggestion anyway. All questions/comments welcome. "

She also checked my armpit, which she said had a ""fatty pillow"" and something with a g (sorry bad memory) which is completely normal.

- In the right breast, 11:00 position 8 cm from nipple, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass with somewhat indistinct margins. Hyperechoic foci within the mass could represent calcifications though these are not well demonstrated mammographically. There may be minimal thickening palpated in this region but there is no definite firm or fixed mass palpable clinically. This measures 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. No associated vascularity. This is suspicious and biopsy is recommended.

- In the left breast, 5:00 position 3 cm from the nipple, there is an irregular hypoechoic mass with somewhat indistinct and lobulated margins. There is some vascularity peripherally. Few hyperechoic foci near or within the mass could represent calcifications though these are not well delineated mammographically. This measures 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. This is not definitely palpable on clinical exam. This is suspicious and biopsy is recommended.

5'6"", \~190 lbs (overweight)

Currently taking 60 mg duloxetine for  depression/anxiety (5+ years). No other major medical issues aside from weight, however, it's worth noting that I have had odd skin symptoms in the past (rash under arms) that cleared up when I did a highly restrictive diet cutting out sugar and carbs. My mother seems to get weird skin rashes every now and then. She also has had breast cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year and a half or so I've been experiencing odd symptoms related to my left breast. We can't figure it out and it's very frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

It started with an intense burning and itching sensation. Then gradually, I started noticing that the left nipple was hard, shiny, and red, and then skin around it was eroded and crusty/flaky. I also noticed that there was a darker gray spot on the tip of the left nipple.

Here's a summary of the doctor visits and diagnoses:

* 9/17 - visit for itching/burning, diagnosed as Mastitis, sent home with cream that did not work
* 10/17 - got ultrasound which resulted in recommendation to get bilateral mammogram due to dense breast tissue; also a questionable mass at the central upper left breast 
* 11/17 - got mammogram - no evidence of malignancy. Bilateral cysts with possible complex cysts in left breast. An ultrasound was recommended in 6 months.

  
\--- this is when the physical symptoms appeared on the left nipple ---

* 7/18 - bilateral mammogram check up - ""Various small simple cysts identified throughout the right and left breast. At least one stable complicated cyst left breast""

\--- here is when I started to get worried (since the test came back negative), took the the internet, and found out about Paget's Disease of the Nipple. The symptoms matched up with my symptoms, and I read that Paget's 1) often goes undetected in both ultrasounds and mammograms, and 2) can mimic eczema and other skin conditions that some of the doctors suggested. So I decided to enlist specialists. I went to the cancer center at my hospital and upon brief ultrasound, the head of the unit recommended I see the breast specialist. In her office, based on another ultrasound and reviewing the physical symptoms, she said there were enough concerns to warrant a biopsy (two, actually).

* 9/18 - had nipple biopsy (included removal of darker gray spot) and core biopsy. Diagnosis of nipple biopsy: focal parakeratosis and erosion, No fungal organisms present (per GMS stain). Left biopsy: FRAGMENTS OF BREAST TISSUE WITH COLUMNAR CELL HYPERPLASIA, APOCRINE METAPLASIA, ECTATIC DUCTS, FIBROCYSTIC CHANGES, AND FOCAL PERIDUCTAL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. Both: NEGATIVE FOR CARCINOMA.  


So, it's now January 2019 and I just went back for my check up to the breast specialist. Within a few weeks of the biopsy I was experiencing some shooting pain in the left breast but it did subside. Physical symptoms have not improved, but I have not experienced burning/itching in a while.

At the check up my breast specialist said she was surprised the physical symptoms had not subsided (not sure why?) and questioned whether she took enough tissue. At this point I decided I wanted to see a dermatologist for another opinion, and we can all figure it out together. In the meantime, she prescribed a steroid cream which has not helped, and my derm appt is this upcoming week.

Additionally, I have been doing more research online and found a condition called **Erosive Adenomatosis** that apparently mimic's the symptoms of Paget's Disease of the Nipple. I am wondering if this is what I may have, and I am also wondering if my condition could be related to diet (as was my weird skin rash under my armpits).

Has anyone ever heard of/treated Erosive Adenomatosis? 

I am curious to hear any opinions or ideas on the condition.

Thank you!

mucusanz,1547978425,"Hi (throwaway account due to people knowing my other, plus mobile etc etc)
In case it helps I’m based in NZ.

Found a lump in my right breast yesterday. I’ve had some interesting interactions with Gps in the past and I’m concerned that I might not be taken seriously due to only being 20. I have a family history of cancer on my paternal side and am planning on seeing my gp this week.

What questions should I be asking and what should I expect with the testing process. 
I’ve read that due to my age I’m likely to have a ultrasound first but am unsure about the rest of it.

TIA for any advice or comments"

I just finished my active treatment on Thursday and I will begin taking Tamoxifen on Monday. I am trying to decide what time of day to take it. Here is my question...

Do you personally take it in the AM or PM? How did you decide? Why do you prefer your chosen time?

Thanks all!"

vikingqueen111,1547847080,I have really lumpy breasts anyways and I just weaned my toddler from breastfeeding like 3 months ago. I noticed it but I just kind of ignored it because I have always had lumpy breasts and thought it was probably something having to do with breastfeeding. But after I was done breastfeeding the lump didn't go away and you can kind of see it it's actually kind of higher up on my breast on the right side and it feels deep and it is sort of large it's not like a pebble or anything. I have an appointment to get it checked out next week. It doesn't hurt at all not if I press on it or anything and I don't have any other weird symptoms. I am chronically ill and undergoing Medical Treatments for other serious issues and this is kind of been put on the back burner. So I'm finally getting it taken care of but I'm really scared about what they're going to tell me and that maybe I waited too long. I do have a breast cancer Gene according to one of the apps I ran my raw DNA data from 23andMe through but no one in my family that I know of has ever had breast cancer. In fact the only kind of cancer that has been in my family is skin cancer and throat cancer. I don't know why I'm writing this post I'm just really nervous. I have a busy week next week anyways I also have a medical procedure where we are going to give me shots of Botox in my bladder through a cystoscopy. Just nervous. I'm a mom and I don't want to leave my kids behind without a mom

She is unsure of whether she should go for a mastectomy or just get the re-excision lumpectomy. How is the recovery time for mastectomy? Do you still have to get radiation? How long did you have to stay in the hospital for? She says she doesn't want to get reconstruction. "

This past year my other aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer. These are my dad’s sisters. I’m wondering what my chances are to get breast/ovarian cancer. I’m only 31. My cousin who’s mother passed away has been trying to get genetic testing and has no luck. She’s being told that if our aunt is positive for the gene then they will test her. So I guess my question is what are the chances my father would pass the gene on to me? I know that men can get breast cancer I just want to know what I should do. I want to be proactive as possible.

I hope it's ok to post this here.

Over the past 4 years, I have been getting small open sores on both breasts. They take months to heal, and will leave behind a red mark on my breast once they finally heal over.

I have been to the doctor who has no clue what it is but being that I am young (30) he highly doubts its breast cancer and will not screen me.

I do not get these anywhere else on my body.

I have had a biopsy done of my nipple as my doctors thought I may of had Pagets disease of the nipple due to skin changes, but came back as scar tissue.

Are these sores concerning? 

Thanks for taking the time to read!"

DystopianAlice,1547318119,"A few days ago I started having pain and clear discharge from one breast.  I honestly just assumed it was some kind of weird infection or hormonal thing.  I'm 32, not on birth control, no chance of becoming pregnant.  After a couple of days I went to urgent care and was surprised that they were extremely concerned about the possibility of cancer.  They sent me to an imaginary center for a mammogram and ultrasound, I haven't gotten the complete results of either yet.  But during the ultrasound the tech left in the middle and came back with a doctor who scanned a portion of my breast himself.  They said I have a large cluster of cysts and called it some thing with a long name, but that it's probably not cancerous as long as I'm not getting bloody discharge.  I also have a referral to a breast surgeon I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with.  They didn't really rule out cancer since it's apparently weird to have a huge cluster of cysts, but they didn't seem to want a biopsy.  I'm really confused about whether I need to still be concerned about this or not or what is even going on?  Also my best is still itchy and painful and leaking so wtf?  What am I supposed to do?"
sunshinybeaches4u,1547276281,"I'm sorry if these are dumb questions. 

A couple of years ago I felt a small lump that hurt and I went to my doctor. She felt it and scheduled a mammogram. The mammogram and ultrasound came back fine.

My grandma and two aunts had breast cancer. They died. A third aunt died of bone cancer. They are from my dad's side of the family. I've had cervical cancer that was found early and had a hysterectomy with no recurrence. It was not HPV related. My mom, sister and grandmother (mom's side) all had cervical cancer. They survived it. 

I have two things:
1. The doctor said best cancer doesn't hurt. That doesn't make sense to me. Is the lack of pain why it gets missed? 

2. My doctor said my family cancer doesn't really matter. Does it put me at a higher risk?

gasolinedrinks,1547093210,"Hello, this is about my mom, we had the apt yesterday after her surgery and there were no surprises other than the one lymph node they knew about (0/9, 1.2 cm) and the breast with calcifications and 1.8 cm tumor (mastectomy).She has an apt with the cancer Center but not for another month!!! Surgeon says due to the lymph involvement there will definitely be radiation and HIGHLY likely chemo. She is upset that she needs both but says she's willing to do what it takes. However...this may sound like I’m judging but...she has a lot of friends who are kind of fear mongering. They are ""devastated"" and ""so disappointed"" to hear that she needs chemo. They are insisting that sugar feeds cancer so now she's beating herself up with the smallest treat. They go on and on about how cancer loves an acidic body rather than an alkaline one - what? Doesn't our body regular our Ph level on its own? I'm so afraid they are going to convince her to go some alternate path. She's already seeing a naturopath but she insists it's to ""integrate"" her through the chemo with vitamin c injections to bolster her immune system. However she mentioned that the naturopath said not to TELL HER ONCOLOGIST that she's seeing him? What? Is it just me or does this sound sketchy. I'm so afraid my mom will buy into this irrational fear of western medicine and skip chemo. Chemo is the best chance you have of not having cancer recur which is way worse.... were so close to having this nightmare behind us. I wish I could take the chemo and rad for her. Can anyone tell me that it wasn't that bad? Thank you."
jcombs0617,1547089273,"My mom died at 43 of breast cancer. At 41 she had a lump. They did a biopsy. It came back negative. At 42 the lump came back. They did another biopsy. Came back cancer. She died the next year.. even after chemo, radiation, and a mastectomy. It was a VERY traumatic year for all of us. 

I truly believe the first lump was cancerous and they just didn't see it. ANYWAY. My question is when can I start getting mammograms? I am 31 years old. I literally just noticed two pea sized spots on my right breast. They feel hard like little pebbles. One right next to my nipple and the other about 4 inches away. 

I am sure it's just some sort of cyst or something caused by hormones or something. I don't know. But if I can be getting mammograms early I would like to take advantage of it. 

Has anyone gotten mammograms at 31? 
Would UHC cover it? 
I have breast implants too, does that matter? 
Any suggestions?

Getmesomelube,1547068248,"I had a biopsy yesterday because calcium deposits, which I'm told are common, were found at mammogram. I am 49. I didn't know until the consent discussion just prior to the procedure that the needle is huge, 11 gauge. It was done in the mammogram machine and so image- guided and electronic. Grateful for the advanced technology, but OUCH it HURTS after local anaesthetic wears off and next day. 
I wish I had known about the needle size. I was not prepared for this pain. Last night I woke up moaning. I had trouble sleeping, as I couln't switch off. I kept thinking about it. 
The two nurses and radiologist were great, but they cleverly place you on your side with arm under chin, hand by head, so my arm blocked view of the biopsy needle. It was a bit bizarre, being biopsied by a robot! 
I took off the compression bandage this morning, and the tape glue is still stuck on skin, and hurt so much pulling on the sensitive thin boob skin. 
It's probably benign, all for nothing. Will find out in a week, they made an appointment. 
Fuck pain. Don't want to do this ever again."

I know redness and warmth are a sign of IBC, but does it usually stay localized like this for a while? I just restarted hormonal birth control, too, could that be a cause?
I guess what I'm saying is I'm scared, and should I be scared enough to go in and check?"
Meow123393,1546917325,"A few years ago my mom had her yearly mammogram. A spot came up. She was referred to a oncologist and the oncologist said it was so small and she was absolutely sure it wasn’t cancer. The oncologist told her to come back in 6 months to see if if had gone away. At this point I was living at home but in a serious relationship with my boyfriend. I told her if she didn’t get a biopsy anyway I was moving out with my boyfriend. Mom is very religious and so am I but this was enough to make her get one.  (My boyfriend proposed a few days later and I moved in the next week anyway :P )

We went to a general surgeon that agreed to biopsy it for us. He had done all kinds of procedures on everyone in the family so we had no doubt he wouldn’t do it. Mom had the biopsy. The spot was so small the surgeon had to used a machine to guide him and there was barely enough to get a biopsy. Afterwards he came out and he told us he was 99% sure it wasn’t cancer so he felt we could relax a bit. 

A few days later we found out it was indeed cancer. The surgeon was generally surprised. It was caught so early Mom only had a short treatment of radiation. I think it was every two weeks for 4-5 months. 

Please, if you just have a gut feeling go with it. "

Jessica_Maya1,1546814009,"**Symptoms of Breast Cancer in Women**

 Earlier writing investigating explanations behind deferred help-chasing recommends that women along these lines determined to have the breast disease may trait non-irregularity [breast side effects](https://www.medfaw.com/symptoms-of-breast-cancer-in-women.html) to other non-harmful causes, for example, hormonal changes, injury, or breastfeeding. While this gives a clarification of why a few females may encounter long breaks to an introduction, there has been restricted examination of demonstrative opportuneness utilizing populace based investigations and expansive agent tests of females with the breast disease. Besides, existing examinations frequently dichotomize introducing manifestations dependent on the nearness or nonattendance of breast irregularity, restricting the valuation for the expansive range of exhibiting side effects inside the ‘non-knot’ breast indications classification.

Persuaded by the above contemplations, we intended to portray the various scope of introducing side effects in a huge delegate test of women with the breast disease in England and to look at the relationship between changed symptomatic introductions and the length of indicative breaks. Our more extensive point was to give supporting proof to educate the substance and focusing on general wellbeing efforts and choice help mediations in essential consideration."

I panicked and hopped out of the tub to tell my SO. I felt like I was going to pass out when I told him. It would explain a lot about how I've felt recently though.

I have been so beyond tired the last few months, and I thought I was just wiped from work. It doesn't matter if I sleep 3 hours or 12, I'm always tired. I slept 15 hours last Saturday and I went to bed early that night because I was exhausted. I have lost weight for months without trying. I've lost over 20 lbs in 3 months. I barely exercise because I'm such a lazy ass. I'm never hungry and thought it was stress. I have weird night sweats.

CKHarrison,1546720135,"I have my first appointment scheduled on Tuesday.  I’ve probably waited longer than I should have, but it is what it is now.

Back in June, I noticed a small, pea-sized lump in my armpit.  After a week or so, it went away.  Sometime around September, my armpit was hurting.  I thought it was just from my bra fitting poorly and a wire poking me.  Nope.  I reach over and discover a quarter sized lump.  Tried some hot compresses, all the other at home treatments, and it just kind of stayed.  I had a doctor friend look at it and she thought it was likely just a cyst.  So, no rush.  It is what it is.  Over the past few weeks, I can tell it’s gotten larger.  I can feel it when my arm is by my side.  It’s woken me up in the middle of night - I have to adjust my position or else it’s uncomfortable.  Not painful.  But it’s like adjusting around a fat roll - it’s there and you gotta shift around it.  

Weeks pass by and now I’m noticing some rippling in my breasts.  They seem smaller.  But I switched jobs, and bought a house, and got a puppy so maybe it’s all just stress.  It’s also Christmas and my best friend is getting married so there’s just so much going on.  I showed my husband the rippling and he says it’s probably what happens when you get older.  

Two days ago, I noticed what looks like dried yellow discharge on the tips of my nipples.  Nothing apparent in my bra.  I took a shower and it’s still there.  

Now the paranoia sets in and I think there’s a dull ache in my breast.  Not all the time.  Just occasionally.  

So, my first appointment with the OB/GYN is scheduled on Tuesday.  I think the writing it on the wall.  Im currently feeling fine.  There’s nothing to stress about until I see the doctor (maybe this is me being slightly in denial and delusional).

I know the next steps are “hurry up and wait,” but my question for you all is **what was your timeline like from your very first appointment? What can I expect at this first appointment? Will any prelim tests be completed, or is that all scheduled later?**

rubyslippers3x,1546657745,"Diagnosed in August 2018, I heard from my friends regularly, at least twice a week either by phone, text, email or FB comment. Just regular everyday chit chat. Family was more random about getting in touch, but they'be always been that way.

Since my surgery a month ago, I really haven't heard from my friends...maybe one text in a month. Only one friend has called me.

I do not share any cancer stories on my personal FB page. I either post in this sub, or on a FB blog page I set up to specifically talk about my BC experience. I mostly set it up in FB to document everything for myself, and so I don't have to constantly repeat myself to friends and family. I really don't want to talk about it &amp; myself all the time.

I have reached out to my friends that I'm missing by text, email and through FB messenger to say 'Happy New Year, how are you', but they have either ignored me completely or said, 'i'll get back to you when I've got a few minutes.' Then silence.

WTF? It actually hurts to feel like I can't rely on my friends for a good laugh and a distraction anymore. I want to hear about their lives as much as I always did, probably more so now than ever.

Has this happened to anyone else? I don't get it. The now I reach out and don't hear back, the sadder I get. I don't know if I should confront them or not. I don't want anything that makes me sad right now. I don't think that's good for my recovery. Thoughts?

Hanshotfirst123,1546636150,"So I finally got an appointment for a core biopsy (2.5cm heterogeneous lesion with a birads 4) after figuring out how tf to pay for it. My insurance sucks and it's $850 on top of my $210 ultrasound copay, which I just got a bill for an additional $250 for that ultrasound. And no, they won't take payments. The financial aspect of this has been stressful enough let alone the whole ""hey you have a suspicious lump in your breast"" (which strikes fear into any womans heart, even if the odds are low). And my husband just informed me he's leaving the country for work for a week and a half 2 days before my biopsy so I get to go alone. It's not a big deal, tons of people go alone. But that just added to my nerves. Does it typically hurt? How long did it take for you to receive your results? Was the cancer obvious on your ultrasound? Thanks. "
Shir0iKabocha,1546635077,"I'm 35 and this was my first mammogram. I got it because I asked my OB/GYN about something I'd noticed: my left breast has grown in the last year. It was always just the tiniest bit larger than my right side, unnoticeable to anyone except me. Now it's a good cup size larger. (I'm a 36J, so it's still pretty subtle looking, but I know my breasts.)

I was called yesterday by my OB/GYN's office and they said I needed some further imaging on my left breast. They referred me simultaneously for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, and to a surgeon. Zero information was given and my brain sorta froze at the time so I didn't ask any questions.

I went and got the actual radiologist report from my screening mammogram. The radiologist report noted that the left breast has tissue asymmetry and what appears to be architectural distortion. I read up last night on what that is and what it means.

My main question: is it standard procedure to refer someone to a surgeon before the diagnostic screening takes place? If it's not standard practice, is it suggestive of anything? To be clear, my surgeon appointment is after the second mammogram/ultrasound, but I would have thought they'd only refer me to a surgeon if they confirmed something suspicious that needed a possible biopsy. Seems a little weird that I'm all set up with the surgeon before they even have the additional imaging.

I know there are no firm answers to be had right now. I'm just thinking about things and this question keeps coming to mind. Any insight is greatly appreciated."

I've recently moved to a city where it's very difficult to register to a new doctors practice and the wait list is very long. That said even if I did get registered the wait for an appointment is 4 weeks. I've recently noticed when I put my arms flat by my side, my right armpit from the side looks a bit bigger than the other. I know about swelling inside the armpit, but does the outer also tell if something is wrong? I can't feel any lumps on the inside of either armpit. My breasts are normally sore to touch and have been for a long time now, is this normal too? I know with periods coming up it can cause pain so hopefully, that would just be why.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last 6 or so months I've also had pretty bad pain in my bones, but especially in my shins. It almost feels like my shins are splintering out my legs it's that bad. I read that breast cancer can spread to bones and bone pain may be a sign of it also, anyone else experienced this?

scaredthrowaway1997,1546510005,A little bit ago I noticed that one of my armpits was a lot fatter (stuck out more) than the other. I googled it after a few months and it said it could be related to breast cancer. I went to the doctor today and she said she found some lumps in one of my breasts and now I'm going in for an ultrasound next week. I'm so scared and I don't know how I'm going to exist until next week. I really really hope it's nothing ): you guys are all so strong and I can't imagine what you're going through.

OnMobileBay,1546487427,"I am on my 6 month of tamoxifen, I hate it. I wake in the morning feeling I have raked a dose off LSD mixed with poison, I am loosing blocks of time totally lethargic, I am the walking dead. I want desperately to quit this medication. What are your expectations with Tamoxifen?"
SelfCareSelfLove,1546483777,"18 months ago I thought I felt a tiny lump under my left nipple, but it seemed to come and go and when I mentioned it to my doc, neither of us could find it.  She said I could get an ultrasound if it continued to bother me, but felt it was probably nothing and so I brushed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

12 months ago I started noticing pain in my left breast, but couldn't seem to tie it to certain times in my menstrual cycle.  I had trouble figuring out exactly where the pain was located as well, as it seemed sort of diffuse and sometimes I wondered if it was left shoulder pain and not breast pain (I have had on/off issues with left shoulder pain most of my life).

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my midwife about the pain (not pregnant or postpartum...have a 3 year old at that time but still see midwife for annual exams), who pretty much laughed in my face and felt around and said it's probably muscle pain (I won't be seeing her again).

&amp;#x200B;

The pain has come and gone, sometimes flaring up considerably and being very distracting.  I find myself fondling that breast often, checking for lumps or a source for the pain.  Other times I don't even think about that breast, though this happens multiple times a week (the pain/checking).

&amp;#x200B;

This fall (about 2 months ago), I decided to discuss the issue further with my regular doctor, in light of news that a cousin of mine was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 22 and was found to have the BRCA genes (she's the 3rd female in that side of the family to have breast cancer).  

&amp;#x200B;

My doc sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound.  The mammogram found ""an area of concern"" on the lower left breast, and the woman did a second mammogram of that breast.  Then I was sent for the ultrasound, and the ultrasound technician said that she was going to check over the ""area of concern"" to see if it was just glandular tissue or something more serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where I'm concerned - the appointment ran late, and I had to pick my kids up from school.  I told this to the ultrasound technician, and she had literally five minutes to look me over before sending me on my way or else I would have been late to get the kids (long distance to the school from the office, and no one else to pick them up for me given the particular circumstances of that day).  She scanned back and forth and said she just didn't see anything at all, and stepped out to discuss this with the doctor and said the doctor may want to scan me herself.  Then she came back in and said it must be nothing, probably dense breast tissue, and to come back when I'm 40 for a standard mammogram and ultrasound.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a report saying that I was diagnosed as having dense breast tissue, and that this type of tissue is more likely to be diagnosed as breast cancer and more likely to obscure the mammogram results, and that I should consider further testing (I think it mentioned like a tri-scan or something weird).  The it went onto say I can have my next mammogram at 40.  My doctor emailed me to say that the results were normal and to have another mammogram at 40.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that the ultrasound technician was rushed, and that the ongoing on/off pain I've been feeling is indicative of something more serious going on.  I guess I'm looking for reassurance that I'm fine to wait five years to explore the issue further, or advice to pursue a second opinion or more testing.  

&amp;#x200B;

Because I have had trouble locating the source of the pain, I told my doctor that it felt like maybe the pain was located in my upper breast or to the left/towards the armpit.  I am also worried this information (which she put on the referral for the mammo/ultrasound), has led the docs and technicians to believe the dense lower left breast tissue could not possibly be responsible for the pain I've been experiencing...when maybe I'm just an idiot and the pain is actually radiating from that lower area and I can't tell.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for reading and for any advice!"
bio-babe,1546467813,"Looking for insight/opinions, and what initial diagnosis’s you have had, sorry for the length. I’m 24F, with a 4yo son. Since my 24th birthday is actually when everything started in late Sept 2017. I do monthly exams and found a lump in my right breast. After going to my OBGYN noting its presence she sent me to get an ultrasound. I also had a large ovarian cyst that eventually disappeared at this same time. I was told it was a precancerous mass but was not showing any cancerous tissue and they would see me back in a year unless something changed. I then had to return to my OBGYN and they stated they thought it could be due to my hormones. From there I got another appointment to go to a Cancer Comprehensive Center. There I was told that it could be due to hormones but there was a very large lump/mass/cyst present (they’ve used all these words so I’m assuming they are the same at this point). She rescheduled a 6 month appt. After that appt I got a call that someone scheduled a biopsy. I called all doctors that had seen me and no one could determine who placed it or the exact reason for it. So I cancelled. The other day I now found a lump in my left breast a little smaller than a ping pong ball I’d say. And my right breast has been noticeably larger, the cyst that they noted last time feels huge and I have little like acne dimples on the right breast as well. They are suggesting to wait until my next period and see if it changes then come back in. I have also been sick with flu/cold/allergies non stop since September and I am usually never ever sick. I don’t even remember the last time not feeling good before then. 

I feel this is a long wait or am over analyzing this? I feel I am too young for things to occur but it seems like one thing after another. "

cleaningsucks,1546457386,"49 F married, 3 adult sons
I was diagnosed with IBC 8/31/17. Went through 8 weeks high dose chemo, then 12 weeks herceptin, perjecta &amp; taxol. Next I had bi-lateral mastectomy with skin sparing and reconstruction surgery. Month later had 30 radiation treatments. Upon completion of radiation treatment, I ended up with an infection around right implant and had to have removed to recover and heal. Also started tamoxifen (for 5 years) along with Herceptin and Perjeta every three weeks for one year.  I finally healed and had a new implant put in at the end of November. Healing is going well. Obviously fighting cancer is tough and now because of some strange vomiting symptoms my Onco order a Brain MRI, A Whole Body Bone Scan along a with CT Scan. Due to the holidays and personal time off I haven't been able to get my results yet. I will possibly receive this Friday or next Monday. I feel positive that I'll be ok but waiting is still wrecking me emotionally. I just want to be done with cancer and get back to normal life. Whatever that may now be. Will I ever have a normal? I feel so broken. I want to cry about having been diagnosed with breast cancer,  but when I do start to cry, I feel guilty and stop. Can anyone relate or have similar experience?"
badtooth,1546454891,"My oncologist, at our last appointment, said that she may want me to start taking a chemo pill - specifically xeloda. She said the side effects are burned hands and feet, and fatigue. She brought it up to inform me, and told me to think about it, but did not say it's absolutely necessary for me.

I have already been through:

- A/C Chemo

- Taxol Chemo

- Herceptin and Pertuzemab IV treatments (still getting those every 3 weeks)
- Bilateral Mastectomy (skin-sparing)
- Lymph node removal (27 lymph nodes taken out from my underarm, only 1 was positive for cancer)
- 25 radiations sessions (high dose to skin)
- Currently taking letrozole pill daily to stop estrogen production, and lupron shots every 4 weeks

Does anyone have experience with xeloda? I have read the info sheets my oncologist gave me, and spoke with one woman who refused it due to the side effects. I am weighing whether or not to take it. I want to do everything I can to prevent against recurrence, but I also want to get back to living a normal life! I  still have a few months to go on my herceptin/pertuzemamb, and years of hormone therapy. I feel like the negatives of xeloda might outweight the benefits I may get from it."

Idontknowhowbout,1546280014,"Hi. I'm new here, but I'm not new to breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy at 16 when I was in high school (I'm 32 now). My mom has it (surgery next week). My mom's sister had it. My maternal grandmother had it. My maternal grandmother's mother had it. My maternal grandmother's brother had it. You get the idea...

My sister and I agreed to get genetic testing done in the next few weeks (after our mom was diagnosed earlier this month).  We are BRCA negative, so it's something else. I wanted to see if anyone here has done a bilateral preventative mastectomy here.

In my imagining they found another tumor, both were biopsied and are around 1cm and ER and PR positive, HER2 negative, since the tumors aren't next to each other they're recommending a mastectomy, and really I just want it all out. I'm putting on this face of ""no one dies of breast cancer anymore, the only reason it's so well funded is America's obsession with the female figure"" (which is what my family's reaction has been, since my mom died of pancreatic cancer and they resented that we knew so little about it before she was diagnosed.) But while I intellectually know I will be fine and just have to recover from a mastectomy and deal with drains, I'm terrified yo.

It’s confirmed dcis so it’s stage 0 - very lucky I guess I itched a spot of dry skin ( that’s) how I found it 
I will be having a double mastectomy on Jan 23rd with reconstruction with implants.  

I know I am lucky and I feel blessed I really do! I don’t even believe I have the right to call myself a cancer patient . 

Luckily where I live (KC) we have a wonderful non profit who bring women receiving double mastectomies a “healing” chair - which is a recliner/life chair for women to use during recovery. The chair comes with a journal and is named after the person who donates the chair. 
My family and I decided to buy a chair, name it after our surgeon and then donate to the organization. 
It’s really cool bc each chair comes with a journal for women to write their stories in and you become ever a bigger family ❤️❤️.

poppyseedbaby,1545932995,"I’ve had breast pain for about 4 years now. It’s on and off, I have it a couple of times a week, varying in severity. 
Sometimes the pain shifts to different parts of my left chest, including my bicep. Sometimes it’s my armpit, my upper breast, lower breast; it shifts. 

I’ve had multiple ultrasounds, rounds of antibiotics, progesterone and nothing helps. The ultrasound only showed minimal swelling in one of my glands but it was marked as medically insignificant on the printout. 
I can’t get breast cancer tests like mammograms because you’re only allowed to get those when you’re 40.  I can’t get a biopsy or any other significant test for cancer because you need to be referred by a doctor, and no doctor will refer me if there’s no sign of something being wrong with my breast.

giruzz,1545685554,"Hello,

Christmas is two hours away and I just discovered that my mum may have/had breast cancer. She has not been very fortcoming with the details and so far I know only:

1) She had an operation in October, she says it was to remove a non cancerous lymph

2) She is doing daily radiotherapy. I think a total of approx 25 sessions, last one to be done on Dec 31st and each session should last approx 15 minutes.

My mum says that the radiotherapy is just a treatment done as precaution and it is part of a research from the local University.

She hasn't told anyone in the family, my dad knows but doesn't talk. I just found out when I return home for the holidays (I live abroad) while my sister doesn't know yet (she lives abroad too and won't come back anytime soon.

My wife and I are not sure how to approach this - we can see that my mum is down and tired but she doesn't want to say anything. My dad doesn't talk (and I never had a very good relationship with him). 

Anyone has suggestion on what to search in the house to better understand what is happening? (Any meds we should be looking for? Specific terms on documents from the hospital?) 

We just want to help but my parents are not saying anything and we think they are doing it to 'protect' us because we live in a different country (for the record, my dad almost died in a car accident 18 months ago and we only found out 6 months after the crash when a neighbor told us)

kelscgw,1545636368,"Hi everyone. 

Just looking for words of support and any experiences you may have gone through. 

My mom is 50 years old and last Sunday told me she had a painful lump in her breast. She went to her doctor, had a mammogram and after the mammogram did an ultrasound right away. They stated that she has thick breast tissue. She is now going for a biopsy on the 31st. 

She got a call from her doctor yesterday to “come in urgently” which obviously scare the crap out of us but it was just to have a referral made to the breast care clinic. It wasn’t her regular doctor and the words he said that have stuck with me are “the doctor is suspicious the lump is malignant.”

I’m hung up on this words - and maybe I’m searching for anything - because I feel they are so vague and can be taken any direction... but should I really be taking it as yup, they definitely think it’s malignant. 

So I’ve done the worst thing and googled everything and so many things state that painful lumps TEND to be benign. 

My mom has lymphoma 24 years ago and has been in remission for 23. About 14 years ago she had a benign skin mole that was another cancer scare. 

Sorry for the long rant.... just looking for similar situations (positive or negative)

Thank you... "

Leslie_Chowder,1545609836,"I’m a husband whose wife had triple negative breast cancer, and we’ve really struggled to resume any sort of consistent intimacy since her diagnosis.  As a male I just lack the ability to truly empathize with a breast cancer survivor (although I am trying), so I am failing in that part of my role as a husband.  Chemo, mastectomy and radiation occurred in 2015 and reconstruction surgeries occurred until late 2017.  It’s been a real struggle as a husband over the past year to understand how to approach intimacy now that treatment and surgeries are over, particularly with early onset menopause.  I don’t want to cause my wife any discomfort but I also know that intimacy (of at least some sort of physical type) is a good thing for a marriage and I am deeply attracted to her physically, so I do want to resume a regular sex life if we can.  My wife will begrudgingly tolerate my advances but the last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable or worse hurt her.  Conversations about that topic seem just as uncomfortable as intimacy itself and I’m sure Im mostly to blame, so I’d like to better understand a breast cancer survivor’s perspective so that I can do a better job as a husband at understanding a survivor’s  perspective, while still trying to have a romantic relationship with my wife.

_ThrowItOut95_,1545544509,"Hi guys,

Just wanted to post this fyi. 

A few weeks ago, my right nipple started to feel uncomfortable.  After a day or so , a lump developed (about a half cm in diameter). 

It slowly got a bit bigger and was really painful.  I squeezed it, and some puss came out. 

I went to the doctor, and she immediately told me it was a cyst. She squeezed it, but no fluid came out. So she told me to book a radiology appointment. I told her I squeezed it previously and fluid did come out.  She told me that's good, but should get it checked just in case. Cancerous lumps are not fluid filled and are painless.

I went down to the radiology place about 2 weeks later, and the lump was almost gone. We tried to do a monogram, but im a pretty lean guy. So we weren't able to get by breast onto the machine. So instead, we did an ultra sound. It turns out it was benign!

She asked me if I smoke pot everyday, and I said yes. 

It turns out that if you frequently smoke weed, then estrogen levels start to go up. This is why the cyst developed on my breast.

Sinnesaurus,1545333734,"Hello all! I have a very specific question that I'm hoping those who have already been down this journey can provide opinions and insight. I haven't even had my surgery yet, but my brain is awhirl with everything I can possibly imagine about pre-, during, and post-surgery - as I'm sure everyone can relate. All the meditation and yoga in the world doesn't seem to quiet it down.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, one of the things I'm thinking about is down the road after surgery. I travel to and from work and carry my laptop everyday, because I work from home in the mornings and evening. I currently use a messenger bag but it's decently heavy. My surgery is only on one side (mastectomy and reconstruction) - is it fine to continue using the messenger bag and just carry it on the non-surgery side, or would it be better to move to a backpack with more even weight distribution?

&amp;#x200B;

I will be working from home exclusively for the first couple months after surgery (sooo grateful for that option), so this is really for down the road when I'm more healed - though I know I still won't be at 100% by the time I'm returning to work.

truthRealized,1545222849,"1. Dec 4, 2018 I had a mammogram that showed an area of concern.

2. Dec 14, 2018 Had a follow-up utrasound that confirmed that what was on the mammogram was on the ultrasound. 

3. Was told to have a biopsy, and that it was alright to wait until after the holidays since I was going to be out of town. Planned to have the biopsy the first week of Jan 2019. 
My husband kept insisting it had to be micro calcifications (why I don't know he is just that way.) So I contacted my doctor's office they read the report to me, it was described as a lesion with irregular borders, (no mention of calcifications) I know that might not mean it's cancer but without the biopsy it's impossible to tell.

4. Tried to schedule the biopsy (should have been simple) my regular doctor's office (internal medicine) has gotten involved, pretty much demanding I come in for an appointment before they will give the order for the biopsy. I called my insurance company about that, they said there is no reason my doctor needs to be involved, but the facility where the biopsy is supposed to be done won't schedule it without my doctor's orders even though insurance does not require preauthorization or that I be seen (again) by my doctor.

What do I do? I honestly am so irritated I am ready to change doctor's (wasn't super happy with him/his office anyway for other reasons) I need this done fairly soon.

Before I moved to my present location about 2.5 years ago I had doctors I trusted now; I have doctors that seem only interested in getting me into their office to collect fees and charge my insurance. 

The holidays are  such a bad time of year to be looking for a new doctor but I have lost whatever confidence I had in them. The office is not run efficiently and like I said it seems all about collecting fees. 

Should I report them to the AMA? Get a new doctor and start from scratch? Write them a pointed note? This is a stressor I don't need, it's not like this is the only thing going on in my life, like everyone else I have family to be concerned about. Help. Please.

summer2498,1545199483,"Hi all, 
My mother (35) was diagnosed with breast cancer yesterday. She noticed a lump in her breast which she got tested immediately. They told her there was nothing to worry about. 7 months later she noticed a lump under her arm which she also got checked immediately. They confirmed it was cancer, as well as the one on her breast. We haven’t found out any more information as she is yet to have tests taken. She’s getting an MRI as I type this. I’ve been doing a lot of research... because she has a tumour on her breast and under her arm does that mean it’s stage 2 or 3? What’s the difference between stage 2 and 3? Will they do chemo or radiation therapy or just chop it all out? I can’t help but think worse case scenario... what if it’s spread to her brain or her liver. I’m so nervous this entire situation is going to get so much worse. She’s so young and we have no history of breast cancer in our family. She’s not overweight. This is just poor luck. After you get rid of breast cancer, will you go back to your normal self or health? Or will you always be affected in some way? I have so many questions and not enough answers... I’m finding this really hard and I don’t know how to cope. It doesn’t feel real."
gasolinedrinks,1545191117,"First of all I want to say thank you to all the patient ladies (and men) who have responded to the large amount of posts I’ve made since my moms diagnosis literally 2 weeks ago. It feels like I’m less alone and reminds me of the good in the world.
She had her single mastectomy today and is doing amazing. The surgeon said it would be easier than having a baby and I honestly think it was! I also think the pain meds are amazing because she is literally up and about and being talkative and the people that want to take care of her are literally shooing her back to bed. Some movement is definitely good though. Since it’s almost Christmas break a homecare nurse is going to be sent to remove the tubes as soon as they fill less than 30 ml’s in 24 hours so that could be even sooner than a couple weeks, we will have to see.

The pathology meeting will be on Jan 8th and even though the surgeon gave us a lot of reassurance, I know nothing is for certain until that meeting. I guess I’m just still a little confused as to why he didn’t order scans for her whole body. She doesn’t have symptoms of metastized cancer but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t metastized. He said the tumor under her armpit was so tiny and it was the only one swollen. But still, can’t the cells jump from node to node and also to the rest of the body? They still don’t fully understand how that happens but it does. I guess maybe once the pathology from the surgery is done then maybe he will decide to order scans or not. Or would he have done that already?

I feel like she’s through the first major hurdle but I’m still so so nervous for Jan 8th. "

Unfortunately, the hospital she wanted me to go to is the biggest in my state and I have to wait a couple days until I can go in. My doctor fears me having IBC. 

I’m very nervous about this ultrasound. My mom doesn’t know how serious this could be. I downplayed it A LOT so she wouldn’t get worried. Her mother passed away from BC at a very young age so it’s too close to home for her.

rubyslippers3x,1544608577,"I want to share with anyone else who is considering tissue transfer IBR (immediate breast reconstruction), and for anyone who has no idea what to consider.

I've posted a few other times prior to surgery, but now I'm 6 days post-op. Had my surgery at MSK Manhattan. Left breast mastectomy, auxiliary node dissection, IBC DIEP.

DIEP flap used my abdomen skin, my belly button was kept in place and when my skin was pulled down a new hole was cut to expose my belly button. The incision runs further around my waist than I had expected. I knew it was hip bone to hip bone but for some reason convinced myself it was only pelvic bone width. It's very tight feeling, but I am standing straighter everyday. There is numbness in my abdomen which I was not expecting, but that may fade and normal sensations may return. The flap was removed with a blood vessel that was acquired through the rectus abdominal muscle, but the muscle was not divided or removed. I have no deep tissue pain at the moment. I have two drains, one on each hip. The only pain I have on my incision is when I laugh...it burns.

My breast tissue was removed through a circular incision and weighed. The DIEP  flap was weighed to match. Through micro surgery that involved taking cartilage and blood vessels from my third rib, the DIEP flap tissue was attached and inserted into the space in my left breast cavity. My skin was spared but not my nipple. I have just started having chest pain now that certain meds &amp; anesthesia are wearing off. I have 2 drains on my breast near my armpit. A circular, nipple sized closure was made with stitches to complete the surgery. I have full skin sensation on my breast, no sensation in the flap location(where my nipple was removed). My entire breast is very soft.

During the surgery, cancer was found in my lymph nodes. I do not have the full pathology report yet. My under arm has numbness that runs to my elbow. 

I spent 3 full days in the hospital and went home on the morning of the 4th after breakfast. Having an IV and drains in the hospital was hard, especially when going to the bathroom. My surgery was 7.5 hours. I have been taking nerve blockers, Tylenol &amp; muscle relaxers for pain, no narcotics. I have showered everyday. I was unprepared for the placement of my drains and incision on my hip, so I only have one pair of pj pants that will work.No undies since my surgery. I've cut a pair of my husband's PJ's with slits on the sides to have another option. I wish I had asked more about the clothing or had bought some of those gowns that hold your drains. The drains, the drains, the drains...please someone invent an easier way of carrying them! 4 scattered drains is very clumsy.

For me, I feel like recovery is similar to giving birth, but a bit easier because I don't have to take care of anyone but myself. There isn't another person I need to keep alive. 

Right now, as with this whole fucking experience, it's the waiting that is the worst. What will my pathology be? Will I need chemo? Radiation? How does this impact my choice in reconstruction?

Overall, I am glad to have done the reconstruction at the same time. It is mentally helping me to see my body bruised and battered but basically the same.  I'm 44 with 2 kids and I can't believe that my story is turning out this way. My parents are saying things like, 'try to make it into your kids get married.' I'm thinking that I'm going until I'm in my 90's. Am I delusional?

I'm happy to answer any questions. I'm also interested to hear if anyone with a similar story. Strength and serenity to all my BC sisters. Be well."

Sometimes it feels like there’s a ballon in my breast and it feels tight.

BriefPause,1544468672,"Wow. I'm 28 years old, no children.

Started off with a breast exam. Found a small lump in my inframammory fold. Went to my obgyn, got an order for an ultrasound. Ultrasound showed a mass that wasn't well defined, went in for a biopsy. Biopsy results show that I have grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. Biomarkers show I'm ER +, PR +, HER2 -. I'm still looking up what all of that means. 

I'm in shock. 

Met with the surgeon today and discussed getting an MRI, and meeting with an oncologist, repoductive endocrinologist, and plastic surgeon. Started discussing about meeting with the oncologist and doing genetic testing and discussing if we should start chemo right off the bat and do surgery later, or do surgery first and figure out the rest later. Talked about if I wanted to retrieve my eggs before starting all of this since I don't have children. Talked about looking to the lymph nodes to see if there was any lymph node involvement. The surgeon then talked about a lumpectomy vs double mastectomy. 

I feel so incredibly lost and overwhelmed. The surgeon I met with today is fairly new from medical school, and I've made an appointment with another doctor that has about 25 years of experience to see what she has to say. I want to get a second opinion but I'm also afraid that I'm going to be in information overload.

Researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane are undertaking research which aims to combine new regenerative breast technology (involving three-dimensional printing) with standard methods of breast reconstruction to provide women affected by breast cancer with a reconstruction that has a more natural shape and feel. 

The technology aims to achieve this by implanting a three-dimensional (3-D) printed breast scaffold (individually printed according to the patient’s breast size and shape) and filling it with the patient’s own fat tissue. The printed implant will serve as the building block for the patient's own breast tissue to grow. The scaffold will then dissolve leaving the new breast tissue. 

A benefit of this technique is that patients will have the opportunity to have a breast reconstruction using their own tissue, rather than replacing their breasts using other options (such as a silicone implant). Importantly, it is a less invasive and easier reconstructive technique, meaning more patients will have access to this surgery with less negative complications. 

After successful pre-clinical trials, the research team is now planning a future clinical trial using this technique, and therefore aim to assess the receptiveness of breast cancer patients towards this new technology.

As part of this project, the researchers have developed a short online survey to understand more about how women diagnosed with breast cancer make decisions about whether or not to have a breast reconstruction, as well as how women may feel about the new breast reconstructive technology. 

As a token of their appreciation, the researcher team are offering participants the chance to go in for a single lucky draw prize of $1,000. If you win, you will receive $500 in cash and the chance to select a charity of your choice to win another $500. There is no obligation to participate in this competition. 

**Who can participate?**  
 You can participate in this study if you:

· Have been diagnosed with breast cancer.

**Please note:** you do NOT have to have had a breast reconstruction to participate in this project.

**What does the study involve?** 

Participating in the study involves completing an online survey. The survey will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes and your responses will be anonymous. 

If you participate in the survey, you will be asked some questions about yourself and the diagnosis of breast cancer. These will include: how many years it has been since your diagnosis of breast cancer, what cancer treatments you received and whether or not you chose to have a breast reconstruction. You will also be asked: If there was a new reconstructive breast technology introduced in clinical practice, what do you think is the most likely event or factor that would influence your opinion or behaviour in relation to choosing the new breast technology over a commonly used operation like an implant or FLAP operation? 

The survey also includes a couple of general purpose questions relating to human behaviour. There are no right or wrong answers to these questions; the questions help the researchers understand more about how people make decisions. 

**How do I take part?**

Hathorismypilot,1544328113,"Diagnosed with stage 1 invasive lobular carcinoma in January 2017. Had a lumpectomy in March and radiation May-July. Started tamoxifen in earnest in July. 

January 2018 - oncologist realizes I'm on welbutrin and makes me try other antidepressants. None of them work - thank goodness I have a psychiatrist that listens to me and was able to work with him. So I was miserable from January - May when the three of us realized this was a quality of life issue and my oncologist let me go back on welbutrin.

No period from October 2017 to June 2018. Then I had a period for two months! I'm still producing estrogen, have a thickened endometrial layer, golf ball sized fibroid. Long story short, after a d&amp;c and a consult with a gyno specializing in oncology, she is recommending a complete hysterectomy, including ovaries since my cancer was estrogen positive.

I wish I had researched more about tamoxifen. I feel like my bc oncologist glossed over the risk.

gigabytestarship,1544305506,"I really hate to talk about this because I'm so afraid.

I'm 27 but a few years ago, I noticed a dimple under my left breast. I didn't think much of it because my breasts have always been saggy and big and I thought maybe it was just the way it was.

Then I read about dimples being a sign of breast cancer. But everyone told me that if I had cancer, I'd know by now. I've had a few blood tests, I had a MRI last year, etc. Everything is fine but I can't shake this feeling.

I'm a hypochondriac and a very anxious person so as much as I hope it's just my mental issues are getting the best of me, I can't get over this.

My breasts seem misshapen, especially the left. It's always been bigger than the other and my nipples have always been inverted. But I've noticed redness and what looks like spider veins showing up on my breasts, especially my left. I get pimples but I have as long as I can remember.

What should I do? Should I go to my doctor  (who I have been to several times this year for illnesses), should I ask for a mammogram or whatever? What are the steps I should take? I'm finally getting health insurance in the new year but I'm afraid at my age no one is going to take me seriously but I'm so scared. 

This is my biggest fear. My dad and my bf are the two most important people in my lives. My mother just died in Feburary and my bf lost his mom when he was 7, I don't want to put them through this but I don't want to die. It also scares me that I could've had cancer for several years and not know it and it has advanced. I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thank you."
ronbri22,1544271823,My mom is having trouble getting her breast mri because laying flat on her stomach with a bad back is making her ribs pop. Is there something else they can do during this procedure. Because she’s having trouble she may be kicked out of a clinical trial that’s been pretty successful.
Dc-sewer,1544225351,"Hello all!  I would like to ask you, all , what to expect, your experience, opinions on treatment,   and what's ahead for my mom and what should I and family prepare for. She is 62, was diagnosed with stage IV couple weeks ago as initial diagnosis.  Her results are, multiple MTSs in spine, 2 broken vertebrae, 2 more affected , MTSs on ribs. All other organs and bones are clean, except the right side LUs and the LUs near spine.   So bone metastases only.
Invasive lobural carcinoma,  grade 2, HER2 negative,   ER and PRO positive (100% and 90% strong reaction respectively). 
P53 negative, KI-67 below 20%.

She is in lot of pain from bone metastases, now using fentanil patches and flector/novalgen analgetics. 
Treatment: She had 1 phase (5days) of palliative  radiotherapy for spine, we hope this helps with the pain.
No more radiotherapy was suggested now and they said to wait 2-3 weeks for full effect.
No chemo, but hormonal therapy with Letrozole.  Denozumab or Ribocillib to be started next week.

Basically I would like to know, is this the right course of action, can I expect she will get better/pain free , and walk again as now she basically get up from bed only when absolutely needed.  What is the normal time to get results of RT if it works and when is usually the check if the cancer is not progressing ? I know the hormonal therapy  can take longer time for results. And of course , what are her real chances with above results ? Overall she is strong and in fighting mood but there are of course bad days too.
Thank you all"
twizzlergirl2018,1544153174,"So I just got word that my health insurance may be canceled in two weeks. I am going to doctor tomorrow for a breast exam and discussion of my symptoms. My girlfriend is feeling very panicked that they might shrug me off and wants me to demand a test

do I ask for a mammogram? Or an ultra sound?? 

"
raege24,1544152320,"I posted about this in a comment then realized others might find this information useful so thought I should share it more broadly.

For those who have followed breast cancer, you probably know that there are genes associated with an increased chance of developing the disease (i.e. genes that have pathogenic mutations [capable of causing disease]).

You are likely aware of the BRCA1 1 and 2 genes which are connected to increased risks of breast and ovarian cancer. Back in 2012, those were the only two genes for which my breast specialist screened me. I have an extensive family history of multiple types of cancer on both sides of the family, including a mother that passed away from breast cancer. I started seeing a breast specialist in my mid-20s after I found a (what turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma) lump in my right breast. This year, in my early 30s, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

Given my family history, it was always more of a question of ""when"" versus ""if"" but it was somewhat puzzling because we suspected it was genetic but had no proof. With the BRCA genes testing negative, we didn't know what else could be causing cancer to blaze through my family.

Just this year, my breast specialist's office started testing patients on a wider array of genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition. 34, to be exact. I turned out to be positive for a gene called ATM, which is associated with a fourfold increased risks for breast cancer as well as a risks for pancreatic cancer. This matches my family history very well, since I had an aunt who died from pancreatic cancer and another who got breast cancer but thankfully survived.

Now that I have this information, I can let my family know they should get tested. There is a 50/50 chance of passing the pathogenic mutation of the ATM gene on to children, so it's important my aunts and cousins get tested. 

I feel better, armed with this information. It finally gave me some answers and allows me to spread the news to family so they can talk to their healthcare providers. I think it is worth talking to your specialist about expanded genetic testing if breast cancer or other cancers are prominent in your family. It may help you and other family members prepare for all eventualities.

Hope this helps!"
gasolinedrinks,1544148166,"We met the surgeon today for my mom and he is thinking between stage 2 and 3. It is in her left breast and one lymph node but they can’t totally say for sure it’s not in other lymph nodes until surgery I guess? He doesn’t want to do any scans so I’m assuming somehow he’s sure it’s not Mets anywhere?! I’m surprised he can be so sure but I feel relieved....her surgery is in like a week so they are definitely getting this done FAST but she is really upset that she has to do surgery, rad, AND chemo. She feels like it’s a lot even though we are trying to tell her it’s the most effective way is to do multiple things. She is a bit of a hippie I guess you’d say maybe, she avoided the mammos in the first place because she was afraid of the radiation on her thyroid. Surgeon said the radiation they’ll do is 3-D so her thyroid will be perfectly fine. Anyway, like so many here said, it is relieving to be out of the flood gates and have a plan of action instead of that awful state of unknowing. Now I just have to prepare to see my mother be uncomfortable which is going to break my heart. How can I make her feel better during this time???"

Throwawayy1998,1544132572,"I know it might sound a bit stupid that I’m going online to ask people, but I think I need a bit of feedback from people who actually are affected/ experienced the same.

So about 2 months ago I found a sizeable lump on my left breast when I was on vacation. It didn’t hurt but it was noticeable thigh when wearing bras or if I slept on my stomach (both of witch I did/ whore as little as possible). So when I got back home I went to my doctor right away, and he said I shouldn’t  be worried A. Because I’m too young (20) and B. Because I noticed it on my period. He said it was most likely a cyst which comes  with hormonal unbalanced, and that it would become smaller with my next period and eventually disappear. 

But the thing is, it was just a coincidence that I noticed it on my period. And even though it might be a cyst it’s still there, 2 weeks after my period. Now it’s feeling soar but is much smaller then when I first noticed it (which was another point of his “cancer bumps don’t get smaller”  he said). I’m just scared I’m putting too much trust in a doctor who is not specialised in the field of breast cancer, and that I’m not taken seriously because of my age. I’d really appreciate some feedback and I’m using a throwaway accounting because I don’t want to shock any of my friends because they don’t now anything about this yet."

My wife was recently diagnosed. After talking with her, and then others, I tried to do a lit review. Problem there is that everything is based around pain prior to diagnosis and pain after treatment.

The thing is, she’s had fibroids before and they’re always benign. So none of us were worried. She feels perfectly fine, she had all sorts of blood tests and stuff around this time too and everything seems fine. However until I know that it isn’t stage 4, I can’t stop worrying.

 We're very pleased with the surgeon and all of the assigned staff at the local, nationally recognized cancer center. My wife is due to start chemo, followed by a mastectomy, followed by a radiation treatment.  
She's now on leave from work.  She's also getting set up with a specialized psychiatrist and support group offered by the cancer center.  Starting to attend an art class there as well.

We have friends locally, offering all kinds of help, and friends and family who'd come at a drop of a hat, if needed.

My mom has stage 4 terminal breast cancer and for awhile now is doing better than from the first day  she got diagnosed with stage 4. She has been put on chemo pills and was taking it with other medications such as pain killer patches, oxycodone, and 3 different nausea medications. She is also taking alternate medicines such as THC pills and cannaboid pills. Today my brother informed me that she has stopped taking the chemo pills because she feels it is making her feel worse. My concern is that last week a nurse came down and told us that the doctor said that it is safe to say that the chemo pills are doing there job. She also has trouble eating anything that's not liquids and also struggles with liquids. So there is a few things I don't know quite for sure such as when she stopped taking the pills and the name of the chemo pills.

Bafabifi,1543851396,"My mom was planned to have 6 rounds of chemo. The first round went smoothly. The second round was horrible, the oncologist decided to stop the IV Chemo and swapped it to oral chemo. That one also didn’t go so well, so the whole chemo is stopped. She was originally prescribed tamoxifen with chemo but because the chemo is stopped, the medication is changed to aromasin - the onc said this is a stronger medication since she couldn’t do chemo.

Now I’m very worried that the cancer is not killed because the chemo is not completed. I talked to other patients and they all seem to complete all 6 rounds - they had horrible side effects but force to continue. I’m wondering whether I should just pushed her to continue with chemo? But I seriously couldn’t bear to see her in pain with the chemo to. But now I’m really really scared. "

Itchyness/ warmth or heat sensation/ Swelling with feeling of heavyness/ aching if pressure applies/ these come and go depending on where i am in my cycle.

Slight areola shape change/ firmness are consistent diffrences. However, i have ""ropy"" or very textured breasts so feeling for new or diff bumps is difficult.

I've also had issues with being constantly tired with aching joints for about 5-6 mo. Normal symptoms if i have a low grade cold so i figured work was keeping me sick at first.

deluxeassortment,1543518048,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I was wondering if you all could help me figure out what to expect regarding a close friend of mine who has stage 4 triple negative metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her bones and liver. 

A little background: she was diagnosed back in 2011 with extremely aggressive breast metastases (caught early), got an immediate double mastectomy, did chemo (not sure how many rounds), went into remission, then it came back in her bones in 2014. She found out she had liver metastases a few years ago, and her numbers have gone down and up again multiple times with various forms of treatment. 

In the last month or so her condition has been deteriorating, first with an ileus, and now with increasing ammonia levels. I know this means that her liver is malfunctioning and/or shutting down. She is in and out of lucidity, her bilirubin and ammonia levels are high, and she's confused off and on. Here's the thing though: Sacituzumab, a breakthrough drug specifically targeted to her type of cancer, is going to be released in mid/late January. I'm wondering what the likelihood is that she might make it until then. I know that you can't tell me how long my friend will live; but I have no experience with cancer or even any end of life scenarios at all, and I don't know what to expect. I guess my question is, is this end stage liver failure, or would it have to get worse to qualify as that? Is it in a stage that is potentially (somewhat) reversible?  In your personal opinion, is it unlikely she could make it for another two months, or are these things unpredictable? She's at home, not in the hospital. Her husband is taking good care of her and is knowledgeable and attentive. They have good doctors and resources. I don't want to ask him any of these questions because he is already totally overwhelmed. I just want to know if there's a typical way things go from here."

I try not to be a hypochondriac, but my mother, her mother and her sister all had breast cancer, my mother was the only one who survived it. Plus I was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer in May, so I'm slightly panicky about breast cancer. I've made an appointment with my GP for Monday. Anyone experience a lump like this before?"
twizzlergirl2018,1543459466,"I’m the least worried. But my girlfriend who is in the medical field flipped out at me about getting an appointment. 

Two months ago I started having pain in my armpit. Thought it was from the bras I was wearing so I went all free-the-nipple for the last month. No bras at all. The pain got worse, not better.

When it became persistent I did an exam. There’s a lump on my armpit. Probably about the size of an acorn. Firm, not moving, but not painful either. I shrugged it off as a swollen lymphnode and moved on.

A few weeks ago I did a more thorough exam and realized there’s another lump that’s similar on the upper half of the same breast. This is all on the same side. And I thought it might e just been the cold, or anxiety, but I’ve been having a difficult time breathing while laying down. It feels like someone’s on top of me, or like I have a yawn that can’t be satisfied. Again, shrugged that off too. 

Finally what freaked me out was the sudden appearance of an indent. UnderNEATH the same boob, is like, a 2” long indent when I raise my arm that was not there before. This is recent. It’s like someone dug a shallow grave under my titty. 

I made an appointment but the earliest was December 7th.

squealninja,1543448881,"Hi all! I am 47 years old and had my annual exam on Monday, and normal 3-D screening mammogram result from February. As for my history, both my mom and my maternal gma had breast cancer, so I'm always opting to pay the additional charge for the 3-D mammogram, as my history is very dense breasts, and 4 fibroadenomas removed while in my 20's. I've been called back multiple times, and thankfully all has been well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, during my annual, my Dr. felt a lump during exam, we talked about my negative Feb. mammo, and that I recently lost 30 lbs., so perhaps he's just feeling the dense tissue. That was the end of that, sort of dismissed, and I didn't think about it really. But, he called me in the evening on my cell at home, saying he went back over my history and all my chart notes to conclude that he's never made observations about it, or comments noting the lump he felt, so he said to make him feel better, he wanted to refer me for a diagnostic mammogram. This is scheduled for Friday morning at 7:45am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering, am I allowed to ask for a breast ultrasound after the diagnostic mammogram? I am well aware that dense breasts can come up negative on mammo, hiding cancer. I want to be sure there is nothing, given my family history.  I mean, I'm far away from meeting my deductible anyway, so I will be paying out of pocket anyway, but I feel like it would help my mind most if I could get an ultrasound in addition, just because of my dense breasts. I'm just trying to figure out how I advocate for that, as here in Utah it's not required that they give me the ultrasound.  They may want to do it anyway after the mammo, however, if they don't I want to request it, but I'm just not sure how."

Ne0nLights,1543241183,"So, I got an account here a few months ago when I was going through some testing. I was diagnosed with cysts, fibroadenomas and fibrocystic breast condition. Since then, I've been putting lots of effort into changing my life... quit coffee (still have green tea though), almost completely stopped drinking, taking my vitamins and evening primrose oil every day. I also have been eating healthy and exercising plenty. I have a strong family history, so I figure I can't be too careful. To be honest, the last few months have actually led me to make great life changes! The anxiety and fear haven't really gone away, though.  


I've been having one weird symptom that has persisted that I can't find any explanation for. I have heat in the one breast where they found a couple small adenomas. It's not distinctly painful, and there are no alarming symptoms like rashes or discharge or anything like that... but it's distinctly warmer than the other breast. Last month it came and went with my period, but this month the heat has just stayed, which worries me. I guess the breast feels a bit heavier, but it's vague enough that I'm not even sure if it's in my head or not. I'm trying not to stress, but my poor anxious brain is still new to this condition. I can just feel whenever I touch my breasts that one is distinctly warmer than the other.

  
I'm having a follow up ultrasound in the first week of December, but I worry that if it's something more serious, an ultrasound wouldn't catch it. Could the heat possibly be from the cystic tissue? Has anyone had anything like this? I'd love the reassurance, if anyone has it to spare."

They scored me Birads 4a and did the FNA. However the FNA comes back showing benign cells (no papillary cells) so the doctor just tells me to follow up every six months in two years. I have some questions:

1. Is it possible for a papilloma to come back with nor mal cells (no papillary shaped cells)? And if thats the case, is mine still considered a Papilloma? 

2. Is it safe for me to live with it like my doctor said? I consulted different doctors they all concluded that its Papilloma, however when I show them the FNA they delayed the surgery and say just follow up? 

3. What are the percentage of a papilloma hiding cancer? Because I dont wanna live with a ticking bomb. It has caused me so much ãniety, dont get me wrong I am super grateful to know thats its b9 but the uncertainty is killing me. They showed me all the crazily good statistic like 95% benign or stuff like that. Thank you so much for your support and so sorry if Im at the wrong place. Much love and appreciation. "

I think bodies are beautiful and I think our imperfections are what make us human. I hate how I look in my bathing suit even though my breasts look better in my top now that I have perkier boobs. I’m in my late 30’s so there’s a huge difference in what I look like now than before the mastectomy. 

I don’t want to be that woman. How do I get over this? I’ve been to therapy about it. I’m medicated. 

They’re uneven. It’s noticeable. My clothes pull to one side. I got the anatomically correct implants but I’m too thin for them to look good. Im having new ones put in in three weeks that will be bigger and rounder. 

I thought that I was mostly over it but I guess because my surgery is coming up soon I’m having some feelings come up about it. It’s so heartbreaking that I will always be unhappy about my appearance for the rest of my life. 

Please tell me some good stories about overcoming this identity crisis. I’ve been struggling for the past 18 months after my mastectomy.

haphaphamham,1542994010,"Hello everyone, 
 I’m asking for my mom.  My mom just finished  her second round of chemo on Monday. I talked to her via video chat today and she looked really beat. She was crying. The thing that worried me was she mentioned that she doesn’t think she can make it. She doesn’t think she will survive this and she doesn’t think that she can go through the other 4 rounds that are recommended. This broke my heart. I know this must be extremely difficult for her but my questions is to those who have fought through chemo, how can I make her want to live? I don’t want her to lose hope because I strongly believe positivity is very important in her getting better. She is not alone. She has my dad and my brother living with her. My husband and I will be visiting her in January. What can I or my brother or my dad can do that can help make chemo easier for her? "

akashinga,1542869411,"Breasts are made up of lobules (milk-producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple), which are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and fatty tissue. Sometimes, fluid-filled sacs develop in the breast tissue; these are breast cysts. Breast cysts are a benign (not cancer) condition. They are one of the most common causes of a breast lump, and can develop in either one or both breasts. For some people, cysts can feel uncomfortable and even painful. Before a period, cysts may become larger and feel sore and tender. However, many women can have cysts and not be able to feel them at all. Cysts usually become noticeable as a lump in the breast or are found by chance during a routine screening mammogram. If you see your GP because you have found a lump, they are still likely to refer you to a radiologist where you may also have a mammogram and/ or an ultrasound scan. If you’re under 40 you’re more likely to have an ultrasound scan only. Most cysts go away by themselves and are nothing to worry about. If the cyst is large or causing discomfort, they may draw off the fluid using a fine needle and syringe with ultrasound guidance. Having a breast cyst or cysts does not increase your risk of developing breast cancer.

sweettea79,1542663309,"Hi there,

In early September I was taking a shower when I noticed a strange lump about two inches above my nipple on the right breast (which is much bigger than the left by the way). I was rinsing off, and my hand brushed it, and it stood out as being abnormal. I had never noticed it before. I had the same experience the next three times I showered. The lump was painless, move-able, and I could almost pop it out. It was about the size of the pad of my index finger. About three weeks later I went to the OBGYN. The doctor felt the lump, and he conducted an ultrasound because he thought it might be a cyst where he could see fluid; however, he saw nothing. He eventually told me to come back after my next period if it was still there. I have been losing weight pretty aggressively, however, so my period came about two months and some change late. I can still feel the lump, but now it feels as if the lump extends horizontally in a rope-like fashion. I'm wondering if that's just the kind of breast tissue I have especially since I'm only 22.

Because I don't have insurance, I'd prefer to avoid paying for another doctor's appointment. Thoughts?"

I am a Obgyn by training and if I seem not to bother you any further I sincerely would require an opening of a chatroom platform for women with one or more breast problems. This will create a special environment to discus health matters that is involve with normal breast Anatomy in comparison with slowly progressive or sporadic abnormalities. It may also interest you to know that more than just the breast may be discussed since the breast functionality as a whole depends  on  several activities of the female body,menstruation exclusively.
Main issue of relevance suffer it that it connects with the breast will be grossly accepted. In that it is formed within this subreddit putting Breastfeeding issues will be the primary concern,not only so but all puerperal issues will also be entertained.
Main issue of concern to this subreddit would be:
Normal breast Anatomy and function.
Problems with changes with the breast.
Breastfeeding problems.
Nipple discharges.
Abnormal nipple discharges (galactorrhea)
Mastitis.
Menstruation.
Polymastia.
Prolactinomas/hyperprolactinaemia
Infertility ( after childbirth)

imsoirrelevant,1542250462,"My childhood best friends mom has stage 4 mets breast cancer that has spread to her bones. She also has stage 4 COPD &amp; a mass on her lung &amp; liver. The worst part about it is that she is still smoking cigarettes (please no rude comments about her habits) and drinking. She has cutback tremendously on both, but still she is continuing it as her choice and she knows the consequences, but she knows she is dying and she said if she wants to drink or smoke while she feels like this she’s going to. 
Basically, my best friend is kind of blind to the situation at times because she doesn’t understand how seriously ill her mother is. We just found out she has 12-18 months left , although they gave her 12 months three months ago. I don’t know what to tell my best friend or how to get through to her, she gets really upset that her mother is still drinking and smoking and I just don’t know what to tell her or the right words to say to her. It’s just all such a mess , although her mom is in such good spirits it brings my friend down just because it’s her mother she has to watch die everyday.  I wish I knew the right words to say to her and her mom. I just don’t know.

I’m a 24 year old with an a family history of breast cancer. 
My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer that metastasized to her lymph nodes at the age of 30, and as of a few months ago, I noticed a small (a little smaller than a pea) sized bump/lump on the surface of my skin of my breast. At first, I thought it was a pimple, but when I couldn’t pop it and when it didn’t go away for a few months I got nervous. 
I have an appointment tomorrow for a mammogram but I would really like some input before then as I can’t get it off my mind. 
Anyone experience anything like this before? 
It’s a circular, small, hard, bump that doesn’t appear to be connected to any breast tissue.

RaichuRose,1542038836,"Hi all, first time poster on this sub. For some background, my mom (late 50s) had surgery a couple months ago for her breast cancer. They removed her entire right breast, and she was home later that very same day. After a couple weeks, thankfully, her lymph nodes results came back negative; no more cancer!

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing left to do is to take the temporary spacer out and put in her breast implant, which is happening in a couple weeks. I don't know the details of this surgery, but I would assume that this will also be a same-day surgery. I no longer live with my parents, I recently moved out after she recovered from the first surgery, so my parents are empty-nesters. However, my older sister (who happens to be a nurse) and I both live very close to them. So of course I plan on visiting more often to check on her and help out, as well as keep her entertained and cheery.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker: her birthday is tomorrow. Right now my plan is to stop by tomorrow with a birthday card and her favorite treat. But I want to do more. I want to give her something that will help her through the end of this hard journey. My mom is the most gentle, nurturing person I've ever known and right now she deserves to be the one that gets nurtured. She is the type that is tough as nails, but hides her pain with warm kindness.

What can I get for my momma that will help her with recovery and/or celebrate her strength as this nightmare finally ends?"

coffinnail_,1541905164,"My best friend was just diagnosed with breast cancer and I'm starting to feel a bit anxious. She's 29F, with no history of anything... until this lump. I went with her on Tuesday to her mammogram and biopsy and by Thursday we got the diagnosis. We still don't know what stage, or really anything so it's a bit hard to know what to plan for. She is scheduled for another ultrasound this Tuesday and we are meeting with a surgeon on Wednesday. 
She doesn't have a family doctor (it's very hard to get one in Vancouver, where we live) but the walk in clinic she was referred from so far has been helpful. I've been trying to help her get a doctor as most people have told me that they will be the ones most of the information provided to, but she doesn't feel it is a priority - which is fair. It's her call. 

Anyways I'm not sure why I'm here... I guess it's just what can we expect? How long is treatment? Is there going to be chemo after surgery? Should I be pushing her to get a family doctor? I'm hopeful most of this will be answered on Wednesday when we meet with the surgeon... I'm just wanting to go in prepared so I can be strong for her. 
Also what kind of stuff did you find helpful from your support person? Or as a support person where did you feel you did well or maybe failed?

awesomepissum,1541894985,"Hello wonderful ladies and gentlemen!

Apologies for potential grammatical errors. I'm an not at English native speaker. Also, I am freaked out that I might be more concretely dying than the median 29 year old person.

My shitty nipples backstory: it is on the righteous one. The on the good boob.  You know, the one that is the most perky, and hurts the least before before you period. The one I focus on the when I send my bf a racy photo. Well, it seem like my good boob was merely putting on an act.

I have had very minor scaling on my nipples before, but it has been such a long time ago I don't even remember if it was on the right one. Tho, in lieu of its shitty state today, evindence points toward it being the right one. Back then I just picked of the scales and thought nothing of it. Stupid!stupid! Stupid!

A month and a week ago I woke up from stabbing pain in my right nipple. The pain was so strong I had to push really hard on it to get some relief. I eventually fell back asleep. I would have probably have thought nothing of if my nipple hadn't been SEVERELY flaky the next day, and this time it also included some of the areola. I picked of the scales, slapped some very strong cortisoid cream on it(I have atopic eczema) and thought it would be gone within the week. 

Well, it sort of did, but never fully. It also started to ich very strongly(much worse than my eczema) And there was always done discoloration on the nipple. I thought the cream might have been too strong, so I opted for a couple of weeks of just adding lanolin. I got an appointment with my GP, who thought it was just thrush. She felt for lumps in my breasts and armpits without buying anything. And this brings me to this weekend. I just finished my course of treatment, and it looks and feels worse than when I had my appointment. It is flaky, on nearly half my areolas, it is very sensitive to touch and temperature. It even wept a tiny bit of clear fluid yesterday and today. There is no scan and the skin is only slighty darker then my (new favourite) left nipple.

I am so scared! I feel stupid for not taking this seriously sooner! I won't be able to book a doctor's appointment until Monday and I am just a wreck. I keep looking at pictures of Paget's, and it looks a lot like that, and I am reading survival rates. I keep reading about how it is often spreading by the time it shows up on the  nipple. Iteels like my right nipple, boob and armpits is a Mish mash of lumps. And I so afraid that I am dying! I know I am young and that Paget's is rare, but since I have already treated for thrush and eczema, and it is confined to one nipple I am struggling with seeing it as anything else.

Do anybody have any kind or reassuring words that can keep from crawling up the wall until Monday?"

The biopsy was scheduled for next week but then I got a phone call at 11am Tuesday morning saying ""We've had a cancellation. Can you come in for 1pm today?""

Heck yes I can. Six weeks ago I was told there was ""A Problem"" with my routine 5-year mammogram. Yes, I could hear those capital letters. Six weeks of follow-up tests (inconclusive and/or inconsistent, hence the biopsy). One week less of waiting after most of three months with the pink ribbon of Damocles dangling over my head? I had work. To heck with work. It was messy. They hit a blood vessel--gore everywhere. I passed out on the floor after the procedure. In the rush to get to the hospital I'd had no time to eat and my blood pressure crashed.

I keep obsessively Googling cancer statistics and calculating my odds. They keep going up, or down depending how you look at it. Family history? Yes. Mom had breast cancer twice, the first time younger than I am now. Mom's cancer was in the same spot of the same breast. Quadrant? Upper Outer, the one that accounts for almost 40% of all cancers. \*Reviews test results\* ""Clustered fine pleomorphic calcification""; the sort with the highest association of malignancy, with slight enlargement of axillary lymph nodes. Not good. My doctor mentioned the former when we spoke last, but not the latter, which leaves me wondering if she didn't notice or didn't want to scare me. The problem with a family history is that having watched mom manage cancer for most of the last 35 years of her life is that I'm hard to lie to. I know it all too well.

I've carried around this worry alone for weeks because I didn't want to scare my friends in case it turns out to be a false alarm. In four days hopefully that will end, one way or the other. 

Now that weird confession: I hope I do have cancer. Has anyone ever said that here? I hope I don't cause hurt to anyone because I don't want to do that.

My life is a sh\*tshow. Excuse the redacted language. I'm 55 with a high-stress, dead-end, low-paying job, with no education and no money to upgrade it. I have no one to support me in this fight. My spouse is a mentally-ill, narcissistic, unemployed serial adulterer. I told him twice that I was off to that biopsy and that it had been moved forward. He grunted assent and never looked up from his phone. When I dragged my queasy and bandaged backside back in the door, he didn't even look at me. It was an hour or so later when I was groaning in bed and he saw the bandage and asked ""Oh, was that today?"" I'm in this alone, folks.

Cancer treatment would give me a hobby. It would give me access to support networks, new friends and contacts. It would get me out of this danged house and give me someone to talk to. It would get me a scrap of sympathy and a bit of time off work. It's a pledge from God that this treadmill won't last forever.

Sorry to sound like Debbie Downer. I'm strong, and I'm actually pretty cheerful if you know me, but sometimes a gal's gotta vent. Here's to Wednesday."
uoc_cancer_research,1541853911,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study at the University of Chester, UK, on daily functioning and psychological wellbeing in cancer patients

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and all that comes after this can often be a distressing, worrying and confusing time. Our aim is to investigate how cancer has affected your daily functioning and emotional wellbeing. We are particularly interested in how this then affects decisions you make about your treatment. Our goal is to help others that might find themselves in your position in the future. To do this, we need your help.

Anyone who is over 16 years of age and been diagnosed with any type of cancer can take part. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that will take around 30 minutes to complete. You will be also asked whether you would like to participate in a phone or Skype interview at a later date, but you don’t have to agree to this to take part in the questionnaire study. While we hope that taking part will be a positive experience for you, we also understand that answering questions about your illness may be upsetting. You can always stop the questionnaire at any time. All your answers and data will be anonymous.

throwawayyy13131313,1541841937,"I’m only 19, so I understand I’m well under the age professionals suggest, but I really feel getting a mammogram would ease my mind. 

My mum, as of february last year has breast cancer. It’s progressively spread to other locations in her body, but more recently her brain. Because of her condition, I get so paranoid at the slightest ache in my breast and want to get a mammogram just to stop feeling anxious all the time about the unknown state of my health. 

So, I was wondering how to go about getting a mammogram? Do I just ask a local GP for a referral or do I go into a hospital?"
Amberedditt,1541837612,"I am happy to report my mammogram was clear! I cannot express the relief that washed over me. I still am waiting on the ct scan . My arm is still hurting after that injection btw. Anyhow, it was a surprise to get good news. I’m truly grateful. Thinking of you all"
roessera,1541789638,"My wife was recently diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. PET scan is next week . Treatment starting in two weeks. 

Starting yesterday (during work hours), she noticed a somewhat throbbing pain in her upper arm, same side as her breast cancer.  She didn’t notice it last night, but it’s back again today. 

She fears the cancer has gotten into her bones. 

As mentioned, the PET scan is next week (which will show all signs of cancer across her body) , but we are living in constant paranoia until then. 

Has anyone had any experience with arm/shoulder pain associated with breast cancer? 

Thanks"
digentre,1541786994,"My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago.  She has had surgery and is now going through chemo.

She is quite amazing!

In fact, before our diagnosis I could not have said for sure that we would be ok but I was wrong.  She has totally blown me away using a single lifestyle rule anyone can copy.

If you have been recently diagnosed I would like to suggest you “remain in the day” to the best of your ability.  If it is hard keeping in the day, focus on “keeping in the moment”.

Negative thoughts seem to come in waves that last about 15 minutes then subside and they typical start with 1 of 2 things - a regret or a worry.

Regretting our lifestyle before diagnosis and/or worrying about what might happen to us tomorrow or next year is like letting some troublemaker live rent free in our heads when all they do is cause massive trouble.  If the thoughts we are having are not paying their way then they need to be evicted.  That is our rule.

The result of this way of thinking for my wife has had quite an extraordinary result on the whole family.  Right now the whole family are all learning from her."
sin4sure,1541726541,"Lets face it folks. I am scared. They found something inside of a mammary duct. 2 mammo done, then the ultrasound.

He told me that next week she goes for surgery. That apparently she’ll be out the same day after a single mastectomy. The cancer is back the same side it was 30 years ago. She had a lumpectomy back then. I have no idea what she’ll be going through. Or what she’ll need. Any advise, any suggestions are totally welcome. "
lordthunderbuck,1541613356,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old female. When I was 14 I got a pain in my left breast. It was on and off for a few months then went away for years, now a few months ago I started getting the same pain again.. the exact same pain. It feels like a dull ache and sometimes a sharp pain that comes when I’m really stressed or really relaxed. I’m sort of a hypochondriac so my anxiety definitely amps up the pain.. I had a cervical cancer worry a few months ago and when I went to my gyno she tested me and it was nothing. Sorry I’m probably rambling..

I have absolutely no breast changes. Nothing with my nipples, no changes in size, the breast is not red, swollen or painful to the touch and no lumps. I have an appointment with my doctor soon, but I’m just wondering what you guys think.."
pm-me-your-snoots,1541612658,"A year ago yesterday, I went for my annual doctors appointment and met with a Nurse Practitioner. I was 22. 

I explained that I had a large lump in the upper right quadrant of my right breast. There were no skin changes, but around my period it would get larger and be quite sore. You could clearly feel it under the skin, and there was a spot in my armpit that was tender. 

She told me it was probably a muscle injury. And that was it. I should’ve been immediately referred for an ultrasound. 

I was diagnosed with Stage 2b cancer in May, which I was damn lucky I even got it then because I had to demand an ultrasound. 

It’s a hard fact, but it’s so important- You NEED to be an advocate for yourself. If there’s a change, get it checked out. And if you’re ignored, try to see someone else. It’s worth it. I had an OB/GYN ask to feel it last month, and she even told me she wouldn’t think that was cancerous. That was on my last day of chemo. Lol.

And if you’re young, or male (I’m not but it’s still worth mentioning), don’t let them tell you “it’s extremely unlikely” because it can still happen. 

Good luck to all you wonderful survivors out there, whether you were diagnosed today or 30 years ago ❤️"

I have fibrocystic breast changes that I have been dealing with for a year. My worst symptom is the pain :( I experience horrible tenderness and pain from ovulation through my period (usually like 2 weeks long) that gets so bad I have to wear a sports bra at night when I sleep.

I have read that vitamin E supplements or primrose oil supplements can help. Has anyone tried that?

eab3794,1541284689,"Question.. so in 2012 my mom was diagnosed with a very early stage of BC. She had a double mastectomy, radiation and chemo and herceptin. Was clear! Very thankful for the success of that situation. However we figured our 3 days ago it’s “back.” She is 60, extremely healthy, triathlete. I am her extremely worried daughter seeking advice. She had a breast MRI and the spot that they found was less than a centimeter in her chest (breast area) the surgeon felt her nodes l, and said that she didn’t feel anything unusual and confirmed it with another MRI declaring it hadn’t spread to her nodes. She has 2 PET scans scheduled for this upcoming Wed. and next Monday... to confirm if it has spread. I’m so worried and just pray every second that it hasn’t. I’m not entirely knowledgeable on this topic... what are the “odds” I guess it could have spread ? We won’t know for sure until those scans and it’s killing me. Is her situation hopeful? How does one small tumor spread? Need any help or info or guidance. If it hasn’t gone to her nodes is that a good sign? The pet scan will be of the whole body in 2 rounds. Thank you-"

Brain_Sci3nc3s,1541124370,"My mother was diagnosed less than a week ago. Already, we're discussing treatments. Needles. Knives. Syringes. Chemicals. I see each treatment, each suggestion, each possibility as arrows piercing her chest. She is the hero I've always read about in books, watching her take hit after hit and continue. I am preparing myself to see my mother fight for me and fight for herself and for her life, and I am terrified. I feel like a child again, scared to step into the dark, but I also feel like I've aged 30 years. Crying so many tears has drained my youth, and yet I crawl to comfort like a baby needing warmth. I will drive her to a doctor to hear what poison her mind and body will have to endure only to leave her with a smile before the sheer preemptive gravity of loss overwhelms me and I pull my car to the side of the road and cry tears of pain, though I'm not the one being hurt. If I could take her pain, her suffering, I would. I would endure to see her smile more and worry less, but I am useless. I am once again a child watching my mother drown in fear while I am told to stay strong for her and pick my shoulders up to show the strength that she has lost. But I am not ready. I am not ready to watch her wither. I am not ready to be a bystander to her pain and suffering...I am not ready to face this with her. But even more, I am not ready to be alone. "

I can’t handle this. I really don’t know what this post is going to accomplish but yeah .

August 18 - we discover the breast seems to be getting big and heavy , we go in , a couple people tell us it’s probably fine and nothing to worry about. They say they are gonna refer us for tests.

5 days later we are still waiting for tests- we call the doctor , they haven’t even sent off the paper work yet, which pisses me off and is basically murder in my opinion but I’m unreasonable and an over the top individual.

We wait around forever and eventually get tests and nothing is being done. Fast forward to yesterday,we have first meeting with oncologist and it’s basically “ you’re dead sorry”

Fuck me . I want somebody held accountable for this . We should have been in that room 60 days ago . We know there was an issue. I should have emptied my savings and gone to the US mayo clinic or something to get more urgent service because apparently Canada fucking sucks.

Anyway they said it’s stage 4, possibly wide spread. It has spread to large lymph node in chest and now waiting for a PeT scan to see how widespread, god knows when that’s going to happen.  To me we should be doing that right this minute , but again I’m unreasonable. 

It pisses me the fuck off that I left that cancer clinic at 430 yesterday and I was the last one to leave- no staff left, no patients left, does the world stop operating at 430 or something? Jesus Christ no wonder I’m sitting around waiting for appointments. 

Since I’m an asshole, I asked what stage it would have been 60 days ago but got a blank stare as if that was a retarded question.  Sorry but if the answer isn’t 4 your whole system are negligent assholes.

AshleyBanksHitSingle,1540836982,"Hi all,

My sister has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. She will be going in for a surgery on November 6th and then will do chemo and radiation once she’s healed. She will have to have a drain in her breast for at least a short period of time.

On the day of her surgery I will be going into her house to clean everything top to bottom, but especially her master suite where she will be healing. I’ve bought her all new comfy bedding, a ton of her favorite snacks, teas and a new mug, a pretty hot water bottle, books, magazines, a new cashmere robe and some new loose cotton pajamas and slippers. 

I was looking online and I noticed there is a type of shirt you can buy to accommodate the drain she’ll have and hold it more easily in place. Should I get one of those? Would that have been helpful?

I’m planning to move her tea kettle up to her side table and move a mini fridge to her room with water for her. 

Is there anything else I could do to make her recovery easier or nicer? I would love any suggestions!

Thank you!"

The only thing she remembered was that she could take off the large bandaid after 48 hours so I helped her peel that off today. There were these little strips underneath (that I now know are steri strips) that we peeled off as well, but when I saw she still had a big ole gaping wound I freaked out and realized that we shouldn’t have peeled off the little strips.

I helped her put new steri strips back on in an asterisk shape, but now I have tons of questions:

1. How long she she supposed to keep those steri strips on? 

2. If she showers then do the steri strips need to be changed again? 

3. I guess it’s too late for me to ask this now, but did taking the steri strips off increase her risk of infection because we basically opened the wound back up?? I feel so guilty and so stupid for peeling those off

She had a mammogram and ultrasound yesterday and the results were not good.  They found a large mass on the top outside of her breast, calcification and 2 abnormally shaped lymph nodes. 

Is there any chance, given the size, the calcification and abnormal lymph nodes that this is a cyst or benign?  

She has a biopsy scheduled for late next week. We have a 5 year old and 3 year old at home (she is a stay at home mom).  And I’m terrified of what might be in store for her and our family in the weeks and months ahead.  

How can I stay positive for her and strong for my family?   It’s been a very hard few days. "
akashinga,1540625574,"Just had a cancer scare and three months of scans, biopsies and specialists. The orthopaedic surgeon says that the multiple lesions in my lungs and sclerotic lesions that were picked up in my spine and pelvis (hard as hell) look like 'burnt out disease'. That means when I had my mastectomy in 2010 they missed a few cells. The 12 lymph nodes they removed were all clear at the time, so I didn't have chemo or radiation. Fast forward to 2018 and I'm having Xrays for a slipped disc and they picked up these anomalies then started a witch hunt because of my history. There was no cancer in the 'hot spots' on my PET scan (I feel like a piece of swiss cheese after all of the bone biopsies). Its been a bit of a rollercoaster- thinking I've had stage 4 bc for 8 years so I'm on borrowed time, and I'm having another PET scan in 3 months time (when my medical aid has recovered!!) but I just thought I'd share..."

beggars-all,1540508497,"So in 2015, I had a CT scan for sciatica/my back and the scan picked up a small lump at the bottom of my breast, near the chest wall.  I was referred to the local women's cancers clinic and got an ultrasound.  Turned out to be a fibroadenoma.  I had it ultrasounded again 6mos post, 6mos post that, and then 1yr post that.  It moved around some, as they do, but it hadn't grown or changed shape.

The other day while putting on my bra and adjusting my breasts I felt another lump.  It's also near the chest wall, bigger, and doesn't move around.  So I called the clinic and had to fight tooth and nail to be able to come back due to my age.  After speaking with a third receptionist she agreed to get an order from the first doctor I saw for another ultrasound and mammogram.

All I've heard is how painful these things are and I'm terrified.  Also terrified of the lump itself.  

So I came to Reddit.  Please help me out - I don't really know what to expect, and if I have to keep fighting for treatment because of my young age."

KomenAdvocacy,1540399644,"Hi everyone! I am with Komen and thought this webinar may be of interest to some people. This will be a presentation on biosimilars and the impact they could have on breast cancer patient's treatment as this is a new drug category.

Below is the summary and registration link:

&amp;#x200B;

""High cost-sharing practices continue to cause a barrier to   care for breast cancer patients. They can prevent them from accessing the   treatments prescribed by their physicians and force physicians to make   decisions based on outdated health plans rather than what is best for the   patient. Susan G. Komen has long advocated for policies to reduce these   insurance barriers, and because of this tireless advocacy, patients are   finally beginning to receive the treatment options they deserve, without   breaking the bank. Unfortunately, we have found that most patients are   unaware of these new treatment options, updated insurance policies and their options for cost-savings.  
Please join us on **Tuesday, October 30 at 12pm CST** for the second  webinar in Komen's Patients' Access to Treatments series, which will focus on biosimilars, a new drug category that are near identical copies of already approved biological therapies. As biosimilars continue to be approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and enter the market, it is expected that more breast cancer patients will start seeing them in their treatment plans. Patient education of biosimilars will be integral in ensuring patients are aware of their options and can make the best decisions for their care.

  Speakers include:  
   \-Leah Christl, Ph.D., Food and Drug Administration   
   \-Johanna Gray, Senior Vice President, CRD Associates

IamMalkiYah,1539976559,"Hello, 

My name is MalkiYah and I am a photographer in the Metropolitan Detroit (Michigan, USA) area. The saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" can be so true. So I have been drawn to do some ""Photography Series Projects that will say a thousand words!

I am doing a series on physical scars on women. Why am I doing that? Because society determines a woman's beauty by her physical appearance and if she has any flaws she is devalued in some way. I empathize because even as a man I experienced a bit of that after my motorcycle accident in 2004. The scars from my bike landing on my right leg and then being drugged for 50 yards, get a certain look when people see them when I'm wearing shorts; you should have seen my leg before it healed . So I can just imagine what a woman goes through when she has a mastectomy, surgery or injury that causes her to have a major scar.

So how does this tie into my photography series? My mother had a double mastectomy and I remember distinctly her saying one day, ""so I lost my breasts, that's not going to stop me from living!"" I want to help women overcome that feeling that, that scar has taken their beauty! I want them to know that their beauty is so much deeper!

That is what this Photo Series will convey. 

So I am looking for women who live in the Southeast Michigan area that want to model displaying their scars to the world, proving that they have overcome the emotional &amp; psychological prison that the world places before them. If you are interested or knows someone interested in modeling (over 18 years old) please contact me @ iammalkiyah@gmail.com."

nickfolesknee,1539278802,"Hi everyone-

I know you can't give medical advice here.  I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced what I am in the middle of right now.

Stats: 37 year old white woman, no family history of breast cancer, family history of ovarian cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I had a breast biopsy one day after my ultrasound.  All the staff acted like it was an emergency type of situation; telling me to make the appointment ASAP, the breast surgeon squeezed me in, etc.  I was really afraid.  The ultrasound showed a hypoechoic mass that is taller than wide, with irregular borders.  I had a core needle biopsy done a week ago yesterday.

Initially I was told that my results were benign, which was a pleasant surprise.  Based on what I saw on the ultrasound and mammogram, I was expecting to talk about staging, etc.

Today my doctor called and said I need the mass to be surgically excised, due to discordance between the ultrasound and biopsy results.  I guess when it looks really bad, but the pathology doesn't support that, it's of concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this, where the biopsy was benign but the ultrasound and mammogram look malignant?  My pathology report showed stromal fibrosis, if that helps at all.  I don't have a lot more information, because I haven't seen my records yet.

I started squeezing it, trying to move it around, feeling my other boob to see if maybe it was a normal thing bilaterally- I unfortunately I realized something was completely wrong. It doesn’t hurt, It’s hard as a rock, doesn’t move, above my nipple and feels like it’s anchored to my chest wall. I check my boobs fairly frequently, probably around once a month or so. 
Also, about a year ago I noticed that my nipples are different shades. The shade difference isn’t too noticeable but one is more pinky while the other is more of a tanish light brown color.

sadshroom,1539210476," Don’t know if this is the right subreddit for me to post this in, but I’m a 20 y/o female and was diagnosed with a fibroadenoma back in August. The Dr. who did my biopsy just called me with the test results, told me to come back for another ultrasound in 6 months, and that’s it. No recommendations as to whether or not I need surgery whatsoever. I decided to be my own advocate, did a shit ton of research, and found a breast surgeon in the area. She urged me to get another ultrasound of BOTH breasts to make sure there’s not another lump anywhere else— because apparently the doctors I originally went to didn’t care enough to do that, so that’s giving me a lot of anxiety now. She also told me that it would be in my best interest to have the surgery because the lump is about 4.5 cm and it’s blocking a milk duct. I’m just really hesitant because I’ve never been under before and I’m more scared of the anaesthesia than the actual cutting-open itself, as weird as it sounds. But I definitely just want it out, especially since they put the metal clip in it and I feel really uncomfortable knowing that it’s there.

Who here has had a fibroadenoma excised before? My main questions are: What kind of anaesthetic was used? Would I have the option to do local? How long/painful was the recovery process? Would I have a noticeable scar or dent in my breast where the lump was? And lastly, should I get a third opinion?"

Chorono,1539124473,"Hey all. My mom had surgery last week removing a mass from her breast. She tells me today that there is a wire sticking out of her breast and she's known this since we left the hospital, but hasn't said anything about it until now. She doesn't even know if it's meant to be there and neither do I. I called the hospital and they told me to call back tomorrow morning. 

Is anyone familiar with this and know if it's normal or if it was left there by accident? I really hope it isn't the latter because that would be really neglectful and careless and I would consider a different doctir if that was the case. 

Also, is it recommended that I go to emergency or just wait out for a scheduled appointment?"
BitterAngryMei,1539088876,"Had my biopsy yesterday. Unfortunately with my birad score and the characteristics of the mass, it is more likely than not to be bad news.

My left nipple has clear watery discharge for a few months. The breast on the inside feels very thickened now. The discharge is very low, as if the nipple's pokey part has sweat. 
I have lumpy thickness in my other breast too.

Earlier I thought my mind was playing tricks and there was no discharge. But one day there was clear wet spot on my bra.


I'm seeing a doc for this who asked my age when I told about the discharge. Then they told me to take vitamin E capsules. That was that. My next appointment is on 25th Oct. I'd like to have some answers before that. If you could help I'd really appreciate. Any info., from professionals and individuals dealing with the same condition, is welcome.

I also had an ultrasound and it was declared by the radiologist that I have fibroadenoma. The masses weren't biopsied. Can fibroadenoma cause discharge?
 
The left breast used to hurt for 4 months. Doesn't hurt anymore.
I'm also taking 25mg eltroxine.
I'm losing weight without effort and very quickly too. But I also have silent reflux, no usual symptoms just pain in throat.

I know radiologists are very black and white and want to be as careful as possible. Anyway, the report says “at least borderline phyllodes” and it’s this weird not cancer but maybe kind of cancer thing. I know phyllodes are rare but I’m wondering if anyone has experience with them.

Do they manage expectations by giving you the worst possible outcome, or were they honest?

lateforadate_,1538699994,"I had my mammogram last week because my doctor was concerned about during a check up. My physician got my results back and I've been advised to get a biopsy ASAP for a 2cm irregular mass. The jagged edges of the mass were worrying. As I make my appointments and explain absence or cancellations, it's like I don't know if I'm supposed to be gloomy because they look at me like I'm an oddball if I can still make a joke. I work frontline, facing customers so I still have to look happy regardless. 

Based on the demeanour of my doctor she seems pretty negative. Do they usually reassure you that it's probably nothing or start bringing up post-operative care? Also, I didn't feel any pain previously but only after they squished me and the lump for the mammogram that now I'm feeling aches. Basically hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Cross your fingers for me."
BreastRadiologyMD,1538693138,"Hi all,

I’m a breast radiologist. I am curious about how you all or those you know were informed of your/their diagnosis of breast cancer. Currently, I call patients and deliver results over the phone. This seems to be the norm. Sometimes, it just feels so cold and detached. I prefer delivering the news in person, and always give patients that option, but virtually all patients choose the telephone. 

What were your experiences? Did anything stand out to you as particularly well handled? Anything stand out to you as particularly poorly handled? 

Thanks."
TheWizardNextDoor,1538682516,"Lately I’ve been feeling a discomfort in my left side and I keep hoping its just something hormonal. I keep driving myself insane by constantly checking to see if my left breast is bigger than my right, if there are any lumps, puckering, rashes that could indicate if it’s Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). It feels like its bigger, and it overall just doesnt feel right with my breast and my armpit a little. Maybe it’s thickening?? I’ve been experiencing itchiness and I do have acne there so I feel like it could be due to that and contact with clothing. The itching does not happen on the right side though. 

My mom was diagnosed with IBC so when I look up the symptoms I’m experiencing I keep thinking it could be IBC even if it is rare. I saw mentions of a certain gene that might increase chances of having breast cancer which I’m wondering if I have that at all. I scheduled an appointment next week to get checked up on and I would like to know how to get thoroughly tested to confirm whether or not it’s IBC. My mom got misdiagnosed, and I fear they might not take me as seriously especially since I’m 20.

I know I do worry a lot and I’m trying to keep myself calm until my appointment because it won’t do any good to worry about this. Should I go to see different healthcare providers to get different opinions? "

I had a slipped disc, went for an xray and they found sclerotic lesions in my bones which set off alarm bells because of my history of BC. Cue MRI, PET CT which showed that the lesions were FDG-avid, plus some scattered, tiny lesions in my lungs. Oncologist ordered a biopsy of the most FDG-avid site, which came back negative for cancer. They sent it off for a second opinion - still couldn't find cancer. Ordered a biopsy of the next most-suspect site on my iliac crest (pelvis), and I should have known when they bent the core biopsy needle and had to drill out a piece of bone that it would be a similar result: no cancerous cells! Problem was that my tumour markers had climbed through the weeks - 46 to 50 to 52, so still worried. Oncologist says it may be that the stress from slipped disc and cancer scare may have caused tumour markers to rise, plus I've had flu throughout.
We're waiting for the flu to go, then I'll do tumour markers again, and PET CT in 3 months' time.
Thanks to all of you who sent good wishes and good advice throughout..."
passthesunchipss,1538619299,"Hey all. I am going to the doctor in the morning to get this looked at, but I don't know what sort of questions I should be asking. I live in Canada, and walk in doctors can sort of rush you out the door, so I want to make sure I am prepared to force them to take me seriously in case that happens. 

It's a small dent, about an inch long, mostly visible when standing normally/hunched forward/tensing arm against my side. I cannot feel any lump, but have found things stating that there isn't always a lump, and that the dent itself can be the only sign of cancer. I can find articles stating that most breast lumps are benign - but nothing in relation to the ""dent"". Is there usually a dimple or dent in relation to a lump, even if its benign? Or is the dent some other symptom entirely? 

I would love to hear from anyone whose experience sounds similar to this. Needless to say, I'm pretty concerned.

I'm so grateful to all of you for the advice, it's all working. The clothing, the pillows, the little things that are my personal necessities within reach of the good arm... this entire experience would be so much worse without all of it. 

Surgery had two parts on Friday, first the removal (and that freaks me out just to write that), then the reconstruction Dr did her thing.
I wound up back in the OR due to a bleeder.  Have almost no recollection of the events and I'm fine with that.  Primary surgeon is my angel. He literally held my hand until I was under, was there holding it when I came to and then was there when I turned around on Saturday morning. 

Stayed one night in hospital, wasn't sure I should go home right away but, insurance. I'm very lucky, my DH and lovely brother are here (bro lives in the Caribbean and came in to the US to take care and make sure I was going to be okay).

ChipNDaleNCats,1538191844,"Hello, first, I'm sure I'm being overly concerned, but I'm in the last stretch with my tissue expanders (exchange surgery in about a month and a half) and have a vacation coming up before then, so I really really don't want anything to go wrong before I get these things out of my chest...

Background: I was lucky, just surgery for me, no rads or chemo. Incisions healed fine, skin doing well. Finished expansions mid July. 
Now I've noticed what I assume to be a sharp pokey edge of the expander on the bottom outer edge of one of my breasts. It's not poking so much that it's blanching the skin, but it's definitely tender and there is a little redness (maybe from it bruising me? - that's kinda what the color looks like). And it's really uncomfortable when I move. Called my Dr's office and emailed one of the nurses pics. She said it looks totally fine and yes, you can sometimes feel the expanders (which I obviously already knew).

I know expanders are just uncomfortable and I should be grateful that I don't have any other complications, but I'm just worried that it'll end up breaking through the skin or something. And I'm worried that it's actually sharper than the nurse thinks and the pics showed.

So my questions are: is this normal? Can expanders shift so that you end up feeling the edges that you haven't before? Can people sometimes feel the ""tabs"" of the expanders (the tabs that they suture inside you to keep it in place)? Are the edges of the expanders really that sharp, and is it common for the edges to break through the skin?

I tried googling of course, but it's like wading through a sea of comments that all say ""yes, yes, expanders are uncomfortable"", with nothing much to find about this particular question. 

Tldr: can feel very sharp edge or tab of expander. How sharp are edges (or tabs) of expanders supposed to feel and can it break the skin?

Thanks in advance anyone who bothers to read this. :)"

While I wait for that appointment... I am also poor. I need to plan financially for myself. 

As much as it sounds like an oxymoron, I need frugal cancer tips, folks. 

Now, sure, I haven't done the ultrasound YET. One could argue that I should not worry. Financially, that reasoning is a risky bet. Depending on what insurance I have and *when* , some treatment options will be off the table in terms of availability. Or unaffordable. 

If I bulk up on my coverage now, before the appointment, the best possible outcome is everything ia good with me and its just a cyst and now I pay an extra few bucks a month until next year, which I can tolerate financially. 

If I do nothing, I could find myself being diagnosed while also having shitty health insurance, costing me not only health, but my job, housing, a lot of stuff before some astronomical oncology bill strikes like a nuke on whatever is left of my financial life. Then also being stuck with a diagnosis and eiter unable to switch insurers, being in a high cost high risk pool, or losing my insurance altogether in some way.

The mass is hard and most of my breast tissue is fatty. The mass does not show on the 3D mammogram, ultrasound and MRI.

strawbarry92,1537930064,"As the title says, I’m currently waiting to get a biopsy on Thursday of a mysterious mass found in my left breast. It’s very small, less than 8mm but I’m so upset, angry, and terrified. I was doing the right thing, getting my genetics tested and going in for a prophylactic mastectomy for trans reasons and genetic reasons. Because it’s prophylactic, the doc wanted all the tests done. The MRI showed enhancements, the mammo showed asymmetry, and the ultrasound showed a Spiculated mass. 

The doc says there is a 50% chance it’s a benign condition, but based on my genetics I’m not holding out much hope for that result. In fact, I’m terribly concerned based on my genes and young age it’s going to be a triple negative doozy. (Like my mom had, and died way too fast from.)

Based on size and lack of observed lymph node activity it’s probably less than stage 2, but even so I am so so so upset. How DARE my body! All my family who died at least had 20 more years of life than I. It’s just ridiculously upsetting. My uncles who might be BRCA1+ (untested) have lived horrifically unhealthy lives and they have had no known cancer scares. 

And here I am, just trying to be proactive, and even at the age of fucking 26 it’s too late, now I’m probably just going to be cleaning up yet another mess my shitty genetics have made for me. Fuck.

My question is, since it is very early in it's stage I wouldn't want us waiting any longer and would want this removed ASAP. I understand that if we do go to another hospital, we would have to go through another process of consultations, tests and then wait for a surgery appointment.

So the doctor sent me for a MRI that I had today - I asked the tech at the end if the lump was visible because she felt it and was shocked it hadn’t shown up on other test. She told me she wasn’t the doctor but - no - nothing showed in the marked area. She said it could mean the lump is the same density as the rest of my tissue.

I took it for 1 month but the breast pain didn't go away so I saw a different doc. who said the contraception was completely unnecessary.

After a month of stopping the contraception I was diagnosed with mild fibroadenoma in the lower left breast. 

Yesterday I found a large, hard, unmoving lump in the upper right breast that isn't painful at all. It wasn't there before and kinda appeared overnight.

I have no history of BC in family.

I hit puberty at 10.my breasts started to develop at 9.

Do you guys have any explanation to this?"

My left nipple is always erect and feels wet. There's no visible discharge. But it does feel cold when I blow air on it.

I had pain in left breast for 3 months. It doesn't hurt anymore. I got ultrasound that showed mild fibroadneosis* in the lower breast where the milk ducts are.

I wear cotton bras and clothing. Could it be drying the discharge before I can see it? It's summer here.

I kept my nipple bare but still didn't notice any discharge. What could be wrong? "
tokiistheking,1537590982,"so to make a long story short i'm a 23/f who has health anxiety. more than a year ago i thought my left breast was increasing in size and thought i felt a lump on the underside. went to planned parenthood, they found a (painful when touched) lump at 2 o'clock on the left breast and sent me in for an ultrasound.
i get the ultrasound done on my 23rd bday (december 2017) and the nurse did find a mass but when the doctor glanced at it, he said b/c of my age it's probably a milk duct. they send me a letter saying the results of my u/s are ""normal""
fast forward a few months and i feel like the lump has gotten bigger. go back into planned parenthood and get the same doctor who says ""i can't remember every patient but i don't believe the size has increased""
kicked myself for being so paranoid (i have health anxiety and ocd) and just felt like an idiot for even worrying and going in again. i refused to keep obsessively checking my breast as i assumed i would just ""freak myself out"".

it's been 9 months since my u/s and 6 months since the last time i was at planned parenthood to double check the lump was nothing.
this weds. i received a call from PP saying the board of directors had reviewed my files and that i need to go see a breast specialist. i got the referral in the mail today saying that due to the results of my u/s i need additional care and need to make an appt ASAP.

my fear is, regardless of how diligent i was getting opinions 3 times at PP and 1 time at an u/s place... could something have been missed or written off because of my age? they are now the ones calling me almost a year later saying that i need to see a specialist. and if it is something, after so many months, would something bad have grown past a """"curable"""" point?? 

i finally checked my left breast again because of this and there is a large feeling lump there. i have on/off armpit pain that i sometimes think i must be just stress-creating b/c my anxiety. i have no discharge or dimpling or change of skin texture, and the lump is sore when touched and to my unprofessional opinion does seem to move when i try and move it around. i know these are """"good"""" signs but.... the fact they called me in again due to what was on the u/s has me scared SHITLESS (the health anxiety doesn't help my nerves). 

does anybody have any insight or advice on receiving such news so long after the original test?? "
OhJaySamson,1537544528,"She's the love of my life, the most pure and genuine woman in the world. And two days ago we received the terrible news. She had a breast lump that had been followed with ultrasound for 2 years, was told likely benign fibroadenoma, that had recently grown and become painful. After finally getting a biopsy, we had the results. Invasive ductal carcinoma ER/PR+ Her2-. We met the surgeon yesterday and are still in the process of getting genetic testing, more imaging, and meeting oncologists and plastic surgeons, etc. It's all such a shock. Just in a second your world gets flipped upside down.

We are both graduate students in medical fields and have state health insurance which, thank goodness, should cover most of whatever she needs. We are scared. But we have each other. 

Does anybody know of any resources or advice for me specifically to help her get through this? I am taking a break from school to go with her to all of her appointments. I will cook her healthy meals, I will exercise with her, I will keep her laughing, and I will give her all of the unconditional love that she deserves. Eager to hear all of your advice. Thanks in advance. "

Labs ordered - no issues with prolactin or thyroid. 

Doc said next steps are mammogram.

 all of her family died from cancer or heart disease...27yo Aunt with ovarian cancer who passed in 1977
 
Father's side has lots of lumps removed from breasts and 1 had a hysterectomy that was cancer related (that side doesn't share personal info much)... 
       
Is my risk only based on family history ... kinda yes kinda no.. I have scar tissue and lumps from past car accidents and sports injuries and I guess they have moved between mammograms.    
They are planning to get me a routine started if  mammogram and breast MRIs every 6 months I'll either have one or the other but checked twice a year.
      
if you have any thoughts on this I would love your input, if I do not need to take a pill that will make me         - gain weight (I've lost over 100)     
- won't possible kill the way my antidepressant medication works that helps me function day to day

My breasts are tender and sensitive and always feel like there is electricity/nerve pain running through them lately. I’ve also felt very nauseas, I’ve had bruises that have lasted for over two months, and migraines. Has anyone had these symptoms with breast cancer?

pivazena,1537287019,"Hi all. I'm not sure why I'm posting right now because nothing is definitive, I think I just need some hugs and some straight talk.

I have always had small ""lumpy"" breasts. I was in for my physical last week, and my GP did a breast exam and said she maybe felt a lump, but also I'm very slender up top so it could just be my ribs, and maybe I want to check with my OB just in case (she also said she was considering an ultrasound). I had an OB appt scheduled for yesterday anyway, so when I went in I let her know my GP's concerns.

The OB found two ""palpable masses, 1 cm each, mobile"" in one breast, and one in the other, and I'm scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram/ultrasound next week. The OB said it's probably fibrocystic. I remembered after the appointment that I had noticed some discharge from my nipples over the past month or so (very small amounts), but it looks like milk-- I had breast fed my son, and still had small amounts of milk production even 6 months after weening, but it finally stopped. Then came back about 4 months later (1 month ago). I messaged my OB to let her know about the discharge last night, but haven't gotten a reply.

So... I think a hug and any advice would be great? I'm not sure what to do, aside from getting the mammogram and biopsy if necessary. I am just wondering what to expect from the mammogram (probably a 3D tomosynthesis), what to expect from the biopsy if it happens, and then... what happens after that if the news is bad"

1) not being able to take my planned and pre booked holiday to see my mum back home, (i need my mum) 
2) finding out I need a full mastectomy and not a lumpectomy, and 
3) if I'll need chemo too. "
frayedends,1536959471,"Hi. I was diagnosed with a ductal cancer in June after finding a lump myself. Between genetics, surgery with a larger than expected lump a complicated cardiac history which required extra testingto determine if I needed chemo and an infection I started chemo (my oncologist calls it AC therapy) this morning.

Through all that rigamaroll I was fine. Didn't think I needed a support group because my depression/ anxiety therapist was there for me. A couple of aunts and cousin my parents and brother were too.

But I now know that was stupid. I got home at 1. I feel fine physically. A little nauseous but its manageable.

At about 2:30 I broke down because I realized this morning I looked in the mirror and the only physical thing I liked was my hair (stupid depression) and its loss is eminent by the end of 3 weeks slowly.

My mom said it will grow back and there are others like me and my aunt suggested looking at chemo head coverings on amazon I did that.

In regards to the not being alone I realized I don't know anyone who is going through this. So not going to the support group was a dumb decision.

I realized that I'm too lazy for a wig a while ago and I stand by that. But today has shown me I need to bite the bullet and shave my head now so I don't stress over it.

I got a heavy weight beanie for free from the clinic. But living in New England we are in the one day its fall the next day it is Summer. So I need something lighterweight for hot days and sleeping.

Mfinancial situation sucks at the moment because of what I needed to get for the chemo. It would clear up the time my hair starts naturally falling out.  I think waiting that long would be a dumb idea for me.

Are there any organizations that donate headscarves and lighter beanies to chemo patients?

uoc_cancer_research,1536927429,"Hello, 

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study at the University of Chester, UK, on daily functioning and psychological wellbeing in cancer patients

Receiving a cancer diagnosis and all that comes after this can often be a distressing, worrying and confusing time. Our aim is to investigate how cancer has affected your daily functioning and emotional wellbeing. We are particularly interested in how this then affects decisions you make about your treatment. Our goal is to help others that might find themselves in your position in the future. To do this, we need your help.

Anyone who is over 16 years of age and been diagnosed with any type of cancer can take part. If you decide to take part, you will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that will take around 30 minutes to complete. You will be also asked whether you would like to participate in a phone or Skype interview at a later date, but you don’t have to agree to this to take part in the questionnaire study. While we hope that taking part will be a positive experience for you, we also understand that answering questions about your illness may be upsetting. You can always stop the questionnaire at any time. All your answers and data will be anonymous.

CancerSurvivorship,1536920140," 

Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

ScuseMeImNewHere,1536818166,"Hi there. I originally made a post 6 months ago on the topic but some things have changed. I think I'm just looking to hear some experiences and I suppose to get some peace of mind. In January I was having some serious issues with discharge and hypersensitivity in my right breast (and I still am). The discharge ranged from being green, milky, or clear and it was sticky. It was bloody twice but hasn't been since around May. I went to the doctor early February and she found a lump. So my symptoms are a lump in the breast, discharge from that same breast, hypersensitivity, and an occasional sharp/pulling pain where the lump itself is.  I got referred here and referred there and now we're finally getting somewhere with it all. Ultrasound showed the mass and the Mammogram didn't show anything so they decided it was probably a Lipoma. My surgeon told me she wanted to wait 4 months to see what happens and to get updated imaging. Well the 4 months passed and I went in for updated imaging on September 7th and the lump has grown from about 3cm to 4cm. I met with my surgeon today and she reviewed the updated ultrasound with the radiologist (who came into the room to check it out himself. is this normal?) and says she can actually feel with her hands that it's either connected to or is inside of a milk duct. So she wants to do an ""excisional breast biopsy"" (referred to as a lumpectomy for patients who have already been diagnosed with cancer) and a ""central duct excision"" to remove all of the ducts in the right breast. Anyway, I just wanted to get on here and see if anyone would be willing to share their stories of how these procedures went for them? Did any of you have the same symptoms as me? How did your lumpectomy or duct excision go? How was healing? Did you have good pathology reports? etc. I would greatly appreciate any kind of advice, words of wisdom, or just some simple peace of mind. As well as I would love to hear your stories if you're willing to share! I hope that you are all doing well and I look forward to hearing back. thank you so much. "
tinytrolldancer,1536697088,"This is hard. I was diagnosed this past May, had a lumpectomy in July. *(3 cells were malignant 2 were benign). Turned out that the cells had been removed during the biopsy. But, better to have the tissue out then take a chance. (it's what I was telling myself).

Went back for a mammogram and the doctor didn't like what she saw, had a few more pictures taken (so smashed, hurt so much) but she still didn't like it. So I had another biopsy because who wants to take a chance, right? 

More cancer. Another few cells. All in the ducts same as it was before but in another spot on the same breast. 

My brain shut down at that point and I said make an appointment or surgery on both, mastectomy on the left make the right to match.
So, I'm having it done next week. I spent this weekend cleaning my second bedroom to make it into a recovery room but I need help and this is the best place I can think of with the best people. 
(I've been lurking but couldn't bring myself to post because, reasons). 
I really need help now. I have an idea of what it's going to be like but I really need to know what to get to make sure I'm covered. Things like what kind of pillows? Do I need a foam wedge for legs? Special pj's? Feather bed or a memory foam to put on the mattress? Slippers or socks? Things like this.  Also, meal prep? Worth it or not? 

I wish I could hug you all or least say thank you for reading.

wink1980,1536677379,"3 weeks ago I felt a small lump on my left breast - inside 8oclock position. The size of a pea. It was never there before. Last week Friday I went to my general practice doctor - she and her trainee felt it - signed me up for a mammogram and a ultrasound for Monday. I went yesterday had the mammogram and ultrasound- my 1st ever - I am 38yrs old. And the techs could feel the lump but saw nothing on the scan. I was barely there 30 mins the radiologist reviewed the scans - never spoke to me and just had the tech tell me everything looked good. I asked why did I have a hard lump and they just said it’s nothing to worry about - what the heck?? It has to be something doesn’t it???  So do I stay blissfully ignorant and accept it as healthy but lumpy suddenly?? Or get a different opinion??? Also my lymph nodes on my right were the size of huge marbles and my left side u couldn’t even see any. Is that normal? I am not sick or even fighting a sniffle. That is the lymph nodes in the opposite breast. 
This is all new to me. "
philippa_jalibird,1536653685,"I went for neck xrays after a slipped disc, and the neurologist picked up sclerotic changes in other vertebrae that he wasn't happy about, because of my history of breast cancer (DCIS 2010, mastectomy, no nodal involvement). Brain MRI was clear, thankfully, but cervical MRI also showed sclerosis of cervical vertebrae. Next was a PET scan, which the nuclear physician initially said looked clear, but then found three tiny nodules in my lungs and a few more sclerotic patches in my pelvis and lumbar region (all low SUV because bone). I had the neck op to sort out the slipped disc, and the surgeon said he battled to biopsy the sclerotic vertebra because it was so hard. Now I'm back in a place where I don't know if it's a metastasis of the original BC (although no sign of a primary tumour) or something more sinister. They may need to do another biopsy, and I'm reluctant to start treatment until they know what we're dealing with.

He broke up with me and it ended on good terms a little over a week ago but I didn't have my breast exam until yesterday.

I'm also weirdly thankful for the relationship and the fact he encouraged me to get the exam. I would like to tell him but I just don't think I can say it in a way that doesn't sound like I'm asking for pity so he might not ever know what he did.

st_mangrove,1536276913,"After 6 months + of anastrazole therapy immediately following chemotherapy, hair on top of scalp, top of hairline and sides came in sparse. It is sparse enough to be distressing although not requiring a wig... ehhh... maybe, but it's on the edge. Cancer doc says it looks ""great,"" (not the word I'd use) and is completely unconcerned, adding that it's probably due to surgical menopause and there is no way to tell (short of stopping the anastrazole, which they didn't suggest). I am angry that they don't even seem to care, and I am skeptical of the data that is leading them to conclude that recurrence rate is that much better if I stay on this crap. They admitted that there is basically no science on AI effect on hair loss, yet after much argument finally admitted that anastrazole was a likely cause - they said they were confident it would ""thicken up"" after concluding the treatment, but admitted it could get worse in the meantime and they don't really know if it will improve or not, yet insisted it was providing a massive survival benefit which they were highly reluctant to quantify. I finally got them to guess that odds of recurrence were 10% on anastrazole and 20% wiithout.

st_mangrove,1536267514,"I was told by doctor that risk of a 2nd breast cancer for a BRCA carrier is about 5% after having a bilateral mastectomy - less than the chance of a first cancer for a non-BRCA carrier.

However, they went on to say that the risk of a recurrence of the original cancer is much higher - 10-20%. With aromatase inhibitor therapy, 10%. Without AI therapy, 15-20%.

&amp;#x200B;

In the research that I have found online, I don't see anything like these numbers (the 15-20%). I also don't see any distinction between 2nd cancer vs recurrence of the original cancer. How would they know if the cancer was left over vs new? I wouldn't be shocked if 2nd cancers had somehow differing biological profiles that could be detected by comparing to the original biopsy, but when I'm reading these Disease Free Survival rates I am highly skeptical that they are comparing biopsies between the old and new cancer, especially when it's not tracking recurrence vs new cancer in the study.

I’m on the small side, so I don’t know if I would have enough extra tissue for a DIEP and I definitely don’t want anything that cuts muscle. And the idea of having an implant under my chest muscles really weirds me out.

For people who have gone with implants, what does it feel like? Does it feel weird to have foreign objects stuck in your chest? Do you get used to it? Does it affect your muscle strength? Will I still be able to lift weights?"

It is round and easily moves upon touch located to the right of my nipple on my right breast, and right before my period it is more noticeable and hurts. Pretty much it feels like a grape that was floating around under the skin. I go in for my first mammogram and an ultrasound. Both cancer(mother had breast cancer around age 50, she just finished up her 5 year tamoxifen) and just plain old lumpy breasts run in my family. The doctors said ""this stuff is usually benign, especially at your age"" and they also found calcifications nearby and wanted to do a biopsy on both. Lump turned out to be fibroadenoma, and I wish that I knew this was a such a common thing beforehand.  I can't say that this was the cause, but it did appear right after I started a new birth control that caused my breasts to painfully swell up and I did not have a lump a few months before during a checkup. The calcifications were dermal (right under the skin, not in breast tissue). They do not know if it's related to the fibroadenoma or not, but I told them I had a bike accident with chest bruising 2 years prior and they said that it is possible that this is a result of scarification. I'm really happy that everything went smoothly, but this is something that I wish more young women knew about."

throw-away1881,1536108168,"When I was 17 I found a lump in my right breast— I then immediately made an appointment at the OBGYN. At that time they did a breast exam and decided I needed to get an ultrasound at a breast specialist.  I went and got an ultrasound and the doctor said it was a fibrous benign tumor— I can’t remember the exact term. The doctor said he would remove it if I felt like I needed to, but he said it didn’t seem necessary so I decided against it. Now I am 19, and last night I did an examination just to check up on the original lump when I found another lump. This lump is larger and directly underneath the other lump. I immediately made plans to call this morning to make an appointment with the OBGYN since I knew I needed an examination before they would do any other tests. However, the soonest they could get me in is 9/27, which isn’t that far away but I’m a worrier! I know the people on this subreddit are not doctors and they cannot “diagnose” me but I would like to hear any suggestions on how to calm my anxieties before going to my appointment. Also, if any of you have experienced something similar I would appreciate if you shared how that experience went. 

It should also be noted that I found this lump while on my period— the second day of my typical six day cycle.  I know it is sometimes common to have swollen breasts during your cycle but this feels very similar to the lump that is right near it.

TLDR: I have a fibrous benign tumor in my right breast— found another tumor last night and made an appointment, however I am a BIG worrier and would like to know if anyone experienced anything similar. "
siriuschaos,1536088933,"Today I went to my Breast specialist to complete genetic counseling and to have my mammogram and ultrasound looked over. I’ll find out the results of the genetic counseling in a few days -up to a week- and I will have an appointment for that scheduled if need be. 

The mammogram/ultrasound consultation has me a bit on edge. There was a spot on my mammo that could be a lymph node, a cyst, or something else entirely. The doctor scheduled a biopsy for that on October 15th. I wish it was sooner but that was the soonest date she had open. The doctor also said that there were some microcalcifictions spotted on the mammogram but she didn’t speak about that too much.

**Background:**

I’m high risk for breast cancer: my mom, 2 maternal aunts, 1 cousin, and maternal grandmother have all had breast cancer, although they were all diagnosed in their 40-60s. I did 23 and me and the color DNA tests but both came back showing I do NOT have the BRCA genes. I also had a breast reduction about 15 years ago, so that's what you're seeing if you can spot the scars.

About two weeks ago I discovered a spot on my breast. I had my annual physical last week and my doctor told me to contact her if it hadn’t gone away after a week. It’s been a week and it’s still there. I’ve also noticed that the veins in this same breast have become more pronounced. Not sure if they’re related and/or if all of this is nothing, but I can’t stop thinking about it and want to hear your opinions!

&amp;#x200B;

I already have an appointment in October for a high risk breast cancer center, so I will hopefully know more then, too.

I really can't imagine eating in that room, there are signs posted saying not to wear anything scented, out of respect for the chemo patients.  Will I just go hungry? Will the chemo make me too sick to want to eat? Will I take a lunch break?

CancerSurvivorship,1535626229,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

Ne0nLights,1535470158,"Short hand info: I found a lump a couple months ago, had a biopsy about a month ago, came back with benign breast conditions noted. Now the breast that was biopsied has swollen up and is hot to the touch and I'm worried it's not responding fast enough to antibiotics.  


Longer stuff:  
Has anyone had a core biopsy and had trouble healing after? I'm trying to be as positive as possible, but after a very tough time learning that I have benign conditions and family history that apparently predisposes me to higher risk of breast cancer, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by what seems to be a secondary infection. About a week ago (maybe two, tops?) I noticed that my biopsied breast was warm to the touch and swollen. For the first couple weeks I left it alone as much as I could, though maybe I handled it too much, and I thought it was healing. I noticed my armpit was swollen as well, and my normally insensitive nipple suddenly had more feeling on that side. No redness, and the bruises healed up, but the pain and heat coupled with the swelling made it uncomfortable at best and painful at worst. I tried to stay calm, and went to a massage therapist last Friday thinking perhaps I'd been overworking and just strained my shoulder, as it is my dominant arm and I use it to work for several hours a day. She gave me a lymph massage, which helped drain it, but also noted it felt just like the mastitis her sister had while breastfeeding. I am not breastfeeding, nor am I pregnant, or having kids. So off I went to a GP yesterday, who prescribed me a course of antibiotics. She told me hormones sometimes cause fibroadenomas and seemed confused when I told her the technicians vaguely told me I had three out of nowhere, adenosis, apocrine metaplasia and haven't started any new birth control. I have not been on any hormonal medication in ten years. I just want to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a day in to my antibiotics course, and honestly, I'm not noticing changes. I think I'm a little less swollen in my armpit, but my breast is noticeably a bit larger, and still warm, firm, heavy and tender to the touch. I'm trying not to freak out, but I don't know exactly what to do... is this anywhere in the realm of normal? Could my breast just be finicky and still healing? Even scarier... what can I even DO if it doesn't respond to antibiotics?  


This is my first time finding breast lumps, my first biopsy, my first true realization that my risk factors are so high. I still want to go for genetic testing soon, but I'm broke, unemployed and having trouble working due to this. I live abroad and I am not eligible for unemployment or many government sponsored healthcare programs. It's terrifying, still. I'm trying not to let my mind reel, but everything I've read is about IBC and how infection is 'uncommon.' Even more frustrating, my gynecologist doesn't seem to have cared one shred about my email detailing this... I mean really, it's a month away from the biopsy and still causing me notable trouble, surely that's something to be aware of? She hasn't responded. I feel so alone.  


I don't know why this has been so hard, I'm just trying to stay positive and not assume the worst. I really hope in the next few days the antibiotics help, this has been such a painful couple months in an emotional and physical way. Thank you to anyone who listened, hoping everyone here is having a calm day."
mmmbopyeauhyeauh,1535257465,"So I got this lump in my left breast and it happened around the end of March. This lump was incredibly painful. I could not even touch my left breast without having a really sharp pain. 
  
Then in April I went to planned parenthood to go get it checked out because by the time I went it had been month of breast pain. I got checked out and all the doctor told me was that it was a nodularity but that she wanted me to go get an ultrasound to be sure. 

Then I went to different doctor and all she said that there was definitely a lump there and that's it. She was not helpful at all. 

So I get the ultrasound done and they told me it was benign and that my left breast is just more dense than the right one.

Since April though the lump in my left breast has only been hurting right before I get my period (I usually get tender breasts before my period so it makes sense) but now it's only just my left breast that gets tender before my period and during. 

After my period the pain completely goes away and comes back right before I get my period. And this morning I felt a slight burning sensation for a little bit but then it went away. The doctors just told me to keep an eye on it.

Does anybody have any experience with this? I'm pretty paranoid it could be inflammatory breast cancer but I know I'm just being paranoid. If anybody knows anything that would be great.

In March of 2018 I felt my first lump in my left breast. Since then I've been feeling pain non cyclical. Sharp and sore.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to my first GYN appointment a week after I found it. She said most likely a cyst for my age. Recheck when I am off my period.

Went back, she said lump changed in size. Ordered an ultrasound for my age.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to get the ultrasound and that was traumatizing. I was alone, so nervous. And the tech just said grab your lump where is it, and I feel like I told her the wrong spot because I avoid it at all costs so she only ultrasounded the top part of my breast when the lump is on the bottom. Two pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

Call from doctors office from her receptionist, not even the doctor. Just said its normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

That gave me peace of mind until the pains kept happening. Then I lost my insurance turning 26 so when I called to ask if I could speak to the GYN about what this lump is and how it is 'normal' was told I have to make an appointment. Cannot afford at 400 dollar appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

Went to planned parenthood. Got an exam by a nurse practitioner who gave me the most painful exam of my life. Saying no lump is even there. When I clearly feel it? Gave me a referral for another ultrasound but without insurance I am currently saving up to afford it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am losing my mind. If this is a cyst why is the pain non-cyclical. I also found out my 2nd cousin has breast cancer (In her 50's) so I don't know if that means anything. I am alone across the country from my family and I cannot stop checking my breast.

Upstairs_Bee,1535034638,"Hi all, I could really use some help/support. I’m 23 with a strong maternal family history of breast cancer. I’ve had a lump in my right breast for a few years and when I moved from TX to GA, I saw a new OB/GYN who was concerned about the lump and suggested an ultrasound. After the initial ultrasound, where three different doctors came in for consultation, it was eventually recommended that I get a biopsy the next week. 

On Monday (the day before the biopsy), I received the official ultrasound report with no explanation as to what was on it. Being an idiot (curiosity did kill the cat), I proceeded to google everything it said. The mass is: taller than wide, irregular margins, hypoechoic, and microlobulated. 

I had the biopsy done on Tuesday, and they found a small calcification during the biopsy. The tissue was so dense the doctor had trouble getting the needle in. They said it would be 3-5 business days before I heard anything back. 

I know some of the stress I’ve been putting on myself is because of me googling, but I’m so stressed I’m having a hard time focusing on other things. I couldn’t find any examples of benign tumors that present in that manner on an ultrasound, and it definitely wasn’t a cyst. 

Honestly, just typing all of this out was helpful.

I went back for a 6-month checkup in July and there was no change.

However......my left nipple is still showing odd symptoms that have been present for a few months.....bright red, scaly/flaky, and hard, almost like a scab.

DeezBreasts,1534852836,"My mom died of breast cancer when she was 50.

I have always had dense breasts. Last year, I felt weird pain and discomfort in a particular area in one of my breasts. I got a mammogram, then they wanted to do a special mammogram on that breast (without me telling them that I felt uneasy about that breast), and an ultrasound of that breast. Told I have cysts and they are harmless. Then I got a letter from them that I am ok, but they want to check me again in six months.

Six months passed, I go back for a special mammogram of that breast (lots of views, lots of squeezing and pain, lots of positions) and an ultrasound of that breast.

Get a letter that they want more ultrasound. Go back.

Asked the radiologist how things seem to be looking. Showed me the calcification in a cyst by the pain and discomfort area, said the calcification looks large, so should be fine and not cancer. But doctor or whoever will look and get back to me.

Have been waiting for the letter to arrive to get confirmation that I am fine and to come back in 6 months. Get a letter that I need further evaluation and to contact doctor.

Will call doctor today. Freaking out on the inside. Trying to hold it together on the outside.

Worried they will say biopsy is the next step. Heard someone say before that biopsy can “anger” cancer and make it more aggressive, and someone else said something about some rogue cells escaping when getting a biopsy and traveling elsewhere in the body, so then even if someone gets a mastectomy, they could get breast cancer from those traveling cells. Not sure about the legitimacy of the above statements, but figured this was a safe space, so I could just fully express all my thoughts.

Read a story on here about someone removing the cancer and then getting it in their liver in full attack mode.

I wonder if the doctor says biopsy is the next step, whether I should go find someone offering BRCA testing and get that done instead. And if positive, just go straight to mastectomy and reconstruction. YouTube played an ad for me of someone doing that (was not looking for anything breast related), plus Angelina Jolie, and a Real Housewife, and so on have been getting these mastectomies if genetic testing is positive, and supposedly preventing possibility of breast cancer.

Would going straight for a mastectomy prevent traveling rogue breast cancer cells and eliminate any possibility of breast cancer in the future? Prevent breast cancer from popping up in the liver or anywhere else at some point?

Apologies for just spilling it all and saying things that might make sense, and things that might not make sense.

Danceswithdragons20,1534694392,"I'm a 24(f). So back story: 4 years ago I changed birth control to see if it worked better for me  for the next month I had an extremely large left breast. It was red and so itchy and horribly painful. An ultrasound was done and I was told I had a few cyst and fibrocystic breast. More than likely triggered or made worse by the b.c. fast forward 3 years (last november) and my Bob is so uncomfortable and I can feel the lumps and some slight clear leaking. I visited a new gyno (I was new to the area) I explained my past and and she felt my breast and said it was cyst. I asked if something could be done about it (hello! I'm in pain. Could we drain it? Run test on it. I didn't specifically state this as I figured she would understand.) She looked at me and says ""well if you want your breast removed we can have it scheduled"". And that's when I said no I meant draining it. And basically she said there is no point as it's a fluid filled sac and might come back. 

Fast forward to January. I saw a new general practitioner. I told her what was going on. She felt around. Could feel the lumps. And sent me off for a mammogram and ultrasound. I was told that absolutely nothing was seen on the ultrasound and  nothing was seen on the mammogram. They did note that I have dense breast tissue in that breast but not in my other breast. The doc thought it was a tad odd that we could both feel lumps but nothing was gotten on the images. She said that its hormonal cysts and maybe where I was in my cycle made them go away/shrink. And I asked for a biopsy then and she said because we ""have no images of a lump that it couldn't be biopsied because they have to know what to look for"".

It's currently August. I'm freaking out. My breast is swollen and one lump hurts so bad that it is interfering with my day to day life. But now my back on my right hand side is hurting. It almost leaves me to think it's a kidney stone but it hurts in particular when I laugh, sneeze, or cough. I made the appointment last week for that but now my breast seems to be hurting and swollen. 

I want someone to actually biopsy my breast lump. I dont want them thinking that because I'm coming in with pain that I just want pain pills. Hell I dont even take tylenol. I just am so tired of my boob hurting and want someone to take me seriously and DO SOMETHING to help.

ivzag,1534676828,"I have always had health anxiety but recently I found out by chance (23&amp;me test) that I have a mutation on the BRCA1 gene that rises my chances of having breast cancer to 70-80%. Of course, my health anxiety turned to health terror and panic. I have been to the doctor 2 times since I learned about my brca status - in December and in June and both times everything appeared to be fine. 

I am now breastfeeding my 15 month old and while I nurse, I constantly am checking my lymph nodes, breasts etc. I sometimes feel... something and I start panicking, I can't sleep, I can't have a normal day without thinking I have cancer. BRCA mutation + existing health anxiety is a very bad combination.  
 
I will continue going to the doctor every six months (or less) but in the mean time, I would be extremely grateful if any of you that have actually had cancer answer since questions. 

1. Could you feel your lump in all positions (standing, lying, etc) and from all angles ( touching top/ bottom part of breat)?  Sometimes when I lie on my side to nurse and I hold my breast I feel a little hard thingie pop up. I can't feel it when I am in my back or when I press directly on top of it...

2. How does a enlarged lymph node feel? If I press deep into my underarm I sometimes feel the tip of a soft pea sized thingie. And sometimes I feel something softer and longer (not circular or oval)... 

3. How long was it after your last exam to the time you were diagnosed with cancer? Is 6 months between doctor appointments too long? Can cancer spread during this time?

I am sorry to write my stupid panicy ramblings in a place where people with actual problems write but I am really, really scared.

But now I’m freaking out because I had sudden bad back pain in the middle, like a little lower than my breast but same side. It got worse once after sex so I thought it was a bad muscle got torn or something? Now it’s not so bad but it’s still pain, not constant but when I move a certain way, has hurt for like a month. And now I read that can be a sign that breast cancer has spread and how a red spot can be a sign. Am I overreacting??? My grandma on my dad’s side had breast cancer and I’m 28"
HyperionAsshole,1534469543,"About two weeks ago I found a large, hard and immobile lump on the right side of my chest, about two inches long and half an inch wide, almost an oval shape. It’s not painful, but it’s fairly big. I went to my primary, and she’d told me to get a mammogram and x-rays. Before I had went to her, I had my mom take me to the hospital, where they told me it was benign, yet did no tests. I don’t know if what I have is cancer, but I highly suspect so due to the form of mass I have, then again the ONLY symptom I have is the mass itself. I don’t know how long I’ve had it, or what runs in my fathers family."
kimkuk,1534360477,"Eat what you like! Is often the advice of doctors when someone receives a cancer diagnosis and wants to know if they should change their diet? A dangerous advice, as more and more studies long-term show.

For the dietary habits can clearly influence both the risk of cancer and the course of the disease. Only now - again in July 2018 - a long-term study was published, which again confirms the important role of a vegetable and fruit rich diet in breast cancer prevention plays.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits And Vegetables Reduce Breast Cancer Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Previous studies have also shown that a high-fruit and high-vegetable diet can reduce breast cancer risk. But there have always been investigations that have doubts about such a connection.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressive Tumors Less Common In A Healthy Diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

In July 2018, however, the International Journal of Cancer read a large - scale, long - term study by Harvard TH Chan Schools of Public Health researchers (Boston) that examined in detail how much of the fruit and vegetables in a person's diet affected their risk of breast cancer could reduce…

The Harvard researchers found that a high fruit and vegetable diet reduced the risk of getting breast cancer and also reduced the risk of aggressive tumors. Aggressive tumors are characterized by the fact that they grow very fast, spread quickly and are often resistant to treatment - such as estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer or even a so-called basal-like breast cancer.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study author Maryam Farvid said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

""Our research now provides the most complete picture on the topic of fruit and vegetable-rich nutrition for breast cancer prevention.""

Farvid and colleagues used data from two large population surveys for their study: The Nurses 'Health Study, with over 88,000 participants (which began in 1980) and the Nurses' [Health](https://www.shelookbook.com/health) Study II, with nearly 94,000 participants (which started in 1991).

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Must Be 5.5 Servings Of Fruits And Vegetables Per Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

One serving consisted of one cup (240 ml) of raw leafy vegetables, half a cup of raw or cooked vegetables, or half a cup of raw or cooked fruit.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits and vegetables protect against cancer thanks to their ballast and vital substances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

Farvid had already published a study in March 2016 in the journal Pediatrics with their colleagues, according to which a fiber-rich diet rewarded with a lower risk of breast cancer. The current study by Farvid, however, suggests that fruits and vegetables can protect against cancer, regardless of their fiber content. In particular, it is the nutrients in the fruits and vegetables - vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals - that reduce the risk of cancer.

""Of course you know that a diet of lots of fruits and vegetables is healthy and brings many health benefits. However, our study will create even more incentive to change personal diets and eat more fruits and vegetables in the future, ""says scientist Heather Eliassen.

How to provide yourself with a lot of fruits and vegetables, we explain here for beginners of vegetables and fruits. In our recipes section, you will also find hundreds of healthy, over-abundant recipes that make it easy for you to eat healthy and rich in vitality every day."
MamaDragon,1534193653,"Hi everyone. I had a mammogram last March and it came back normal, but stated that I have dense tissue that might make it difficult to see tumors.

Well I just went for my yearly mammogram a few days ago and was called today to come back for more imaging in both breasts and a possible ultrasound.

I am just wondering what to expect with the second visit. I was leaving work when they called me and I was a little frazzled and didn't ask any questions.


I do know the tech said I was her best patient all day and she was able to get good pics. Which freaks me out a little more. 


I'm not sure why I started having mammograms before 40 (I'll be 40 in October), but my Dr suggested it last year and I just went with it. Possibly because there is ovarian cancer in my family? Idk, that's speculation. Anyway, I'm kinda freaked out. My appt isn't until the 24th. My fiancé is out of town until tomorrow and I don't want him to stress on his trip so I haven't told him.

Thanks in advance."

DoutorPapai,1534148594,"Found this a little more than a month ago. Got the result of the ultrasonography last saturday. I'll schedule the mastologist because I went first to the general practitionist. He said the lump is kinda big even though the exam says this is small. Should I consider it small or not after all?

My older sister had a similar problem a few years ago, but the lump turned out to be benign. She removed it and she is okay now. She even had a boy and has lots os milk. Mine hurts the I touch it.

Pretty nervous about this. Feeling NOT GOOD AT ALL. Problably I'll have the final disgnosis (benign or malignant) in about two or three weeks. Is it too longe? Please give me your oppinions. Here is the result of the ultrasonography (I hope I didn't make any translation mistake):


Exam made with High Frequency Linear Transducer.

Mammas with composition of the tissue predominantly fibroglandular.

Normal thickness skin.

Right mamma without evidence of nodes of pathologic signification.

Left mamma presenting hypoechoic node, homogeneous, measuring 1,3 x 0,8 x 1,0 cm, placed on the subareolar region.

Subcutaneous cell tissue without echographic changes.

Absence of nodes on the regions: supraclavicular, infraclavicular and parasternal.

CONCLUSION: Small solid node on the left mamma (subareolar)

CATEGORY: BI-RADS(R) 3 - Findings probably benign

RECOMENDATION OF CONDUCT DUE TO BI-RADS(R): PROCEED INVESTIGATION WITH CITO-HISTOPATHOLOGYCAL STUDY, ACCORDING TO CLYNICAL JUDGEMENT.

OBSERVATIONS: REPORT MADE SECOND TO AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY 2003"

I have dense breast tissue and have had to go back several years ago for a recheck which was clear. Not this time. I was called back in two days. Instead of just a sonogram, they ordered a sonogram AND an additional mammogram. My gynocologist called me the NEXT day, himself, telling me the reading was ""low chance of malignancy"" I had a feeling this was going to happen (I felt it in my gut) and I always feel like it's more serious when call backs happen so quickly and it's the actual doctor that calls. What I didn't expect was him referring me to a general surgeon, who then called the next day (which was yesterday). I now have an appointment for a ""consultation"" with the surgeon in a week and a half and he may or may not do the biopsy that day. Maybe that's common, but it didn't feel common. I've been through adenocarcinoma in situ (basically stage 0 cervical cancer) and had a hysterectomy so naturally, I'm a little concerned. OK, I'd be concerned anyway. Is this the normal path? I remember how sick to my stomach I was during my cervical cancer rodeo, and I'm sure every hospital / state / doctor has different methods of this course but what should I expect? Is it routine to have a consultation first, or is this a scenario of, I'm going to the surgeon for him to tell me I do have breast cancer and we are going to sit down and discuss options. I'm trying to be positive, I also want to be prepared.

LilBurritoFeet,1533607915,"Sorry if you've read my story before but BACKGROUND: I am 36 weeks pregnant (getting induced on Saturday!) and was diagnosed in May with Stage 3 triple negative breast cancer with the BRCA1 mutation. I've done 4 AC treatments and once the baby is here will start Taxol/Carboplatin once a week for 12 weeks and then will have a double mastectomy. 

ANYWAY! It's been a rough couple of months for us. People have been really supportive and helpful but we had a conversation that has really made me feel sad for him. 

I asked how he was doing and he kinda sighed and told me that he's struggling. He said that anytime someone talks to him they ask how I'm doing but they never ask how he's doing. He's the sole earner in our family (I was a SAHM before this shocking discovery) and with our med bills he's had to consistently work over time just to cover everything. I know he's getting strung out with that and then with all this stuff (cancer, having a 17 month old, about to have a newborn) I'm sure life just feels bad for him. His family is not very supportive but he has a really close relationship with my family (mostly my Mom).

His friends seem to be really distant. His closest friend invited him on a fishing trip the week after our baby will be born with no idea that this would not be a very realistic option for him. He's open to therapy but how does anyone find the time to do that? I guess the answer is to make time but does anyone have any other tips? Would it be weird if I reached out to his friends and said hey can you check on him? 

I'm just trying to make sure he's taken care of during all this because I'm sure it feels like he's been thrown by the wayside and there's nothing I want more than for him to know how much I love, care about, and appreciate him for everything he has done for me and our family.

CancerSurvivorship,1533048268,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

Ne0nLights,1533007279,"Firstly, this whole community is wonderful and I'm glad I've found it.

I found a lump in my breast a couple months ago and after monitoring it for a short while and assessing that I have a strong family history, got a clinical exam and an ultrasound. I'm on the young side (29) and everyone I spoke to was helpful. The radiologist told me my lump is a fibroadenoma and that I had several small cysts in the one breast, clear in the other. I requested and will be setting up a biopsy regardless, as I'm feeling pain in my breast and armpit still, and as I'm sure a lot of you have thought, it's best to be thorough. Fortunately the specialists I spoke to were all supportive of this, even if it's only to help me sleep better. I'm really grateful for their responsiveness (and the assurance that this is probably benign, radiologist said he was 99% certain and I do appreciate those odds), but it's hard to not keep worrying.  


What are some techniques that might help reduce the stress of all this?"
itsallesha,1532742201,"So I am having my first biopsy next week and feeling really anxious/scared. I think it is likely benign, but this is my second tumor and this is the first time they have said they wanted to biopsy. 

Background: I am 23 and have had a previous fibroadenoma (at least they suspected). I don’t know the size of my current lump because I forgot to ask because I was so surprised by them saying they wanted to biopsy. By my best guess it is between 7-15mm. Both of my lumps are quite moveable (unlike many cancerous tumors). Because of my age and the nature of the masses themselves, I know it is unlikely that they are cancerous. BUT while I was at the office the radiologist and the folks who did my mammogram and ultrasound were very anxious and concerned me. I was so shocked by the fact that they wanted to biopsy that I didn’t ask enough questions, or the right questions. Every person seemed to be super sensitive and kind of evasive. I haven’t experienced this with my last lump and was really surprised by the difference. 

I know for my circumstances, cancer is unlikely, but I can’t help but feel very scared. I never thought this was something I would have to deal with, and now it’s here and I’m panicking, even though I have good reasons to keep a level head. 

My questions are: what is the biopsy like itself? If it were to be cancerous, what are my next steps? If not, what have been the experience for other folks with reoccurring fibroadenomas? 

Thanks for any help/advice. "

triniaries,1532566088,"Hi all,

Still pre-treatment while doctors do all the scans possible but I did get a CT of my chest that said they found a 3mm nodule on my lung that is ""inconclusive and possibly postinflammatory"" and I thought I was calm about this but I am not. This post may be long so skip to the end or ignore all together if you need to.

Background: All scans so far have/ are being processed by the place where I got my original diagnosis but I have since transferred care and they do not have all the records and of course, the original place of diagnosis is being slow as hell with releasing them. I've done ultrasound guided biopsy which confirmed diagnosis, breast MRI, bone scan and CT scan.

Oncologist at original place of diagnosis said breast MRI came back saying cancer was still local with one lymph node looking enlarged but ""inconclusive"". She said it was fine...

Surgeon at second opinion location saw just the breast MRI and ordered another ultrasound and a fine needle aspiration biopsy which was done today.

I received a phone call from original place of diagnosis saying bone scan and CT scan (which second opinion place has not received yet) looked good and were fine. Nurse asked if I had made a decision on where I was seeking care and said there was no rush. She didn't even mention the nodule on my lung. I read it in my report on the online patient portal.

My question is this: **How likely is it this is a distant metasis when one lymph node is enlarged based on my breast MRI and ultrasound?** The results from my fine needle aspiration won't come in for three days, second opinion place still hasn't been given the imaging from my CT scan  and I trust them more. Plus I'm supposed to start chemo Monday for what was supposed to be Stage 2a but might now be at least Stage 2b if it hasn't jumped to Stage 4.

Thanks in advance for putting up with my crazy.

tl/dr: 3mm nodule on lung, 1 possible but unconfirmed cancerous lymph node. What are the chances the nodule is a distant met occurrence? "
katatat666,1532504635,"Hi everyone, 

Last month I was having an annual exam done and a lump was found in my left breast. From there, I was sent for an ultrasound. After the ultrasound, I was told to check back in 6 months. When my doctor received the images she sent me to a specialist. The specialist gave me the option of a needle biopsy but because of the position of my lump, removing it would be better. Anyways, I had the lump removed last Tuesday and waiting to hear results. They scheduled an appointment the day of surgery to come back the following Thursday to discuss my results. Is no news good news? No calls from the doc. I'm 100% prepared for whatever comes at me, but just anxious as hell about Thursday and the unknown.

KindheartedSnuggle,1532482922,"I've had this one lump in my breast for probably over a year, and it never bothered me, but lately i'd been having chest pains so went to the doctors, where she listened to my heart (because I thought that's what the issue was) but then she asked me to take off my top and started feeling around, so I piped up and mentioned the pea sized lump. She then ordered I have an xray and an ultrasound on both breasts. When the results came back she phoned and left a message explaining that they were just complex cysts nothing to be cause for concern... but then a week later I get an email from the doctors office wanting me to come in to discuss the results. Okay? She then explained she would like me to have a fine needle aspiration biopsy done on the cysts, but was quite vague about it all. I'm not concerned in the slightest (and maybe I should be) but Is this a fairly normal procedure for people with complex cysts? "
Lakota_Six,1532480657,"First mammogram in November, where a lump was discovered, so an ultrasound was ordered as a follow-up. Doctor decided to wait and do a six-month follow-up to see if anything had changed.

Had the second ultrasound yesterday (little late due to scheduling conflicts) and there was a change, so I had a hollow-core biopsy done today, where they took five samples.

The biopsy itself went fine. What's stressing me out is the doctor's response when I asked how much of a change there was.

""Well...it's enough that I'm concerned about it...the only way to be sure is to biopsy it....most are benign...but we don't know for sure until the results come back..."" He just seemed to be hedging his answers and more or less evading my question. 

A simple, more cheerful, ""Oh, anytime there are changes, we do a biopsy just to make sure"" would have set my mind much more at ease, if you know what I mean.

Now I sit and wait for the results in 3 to 5 days. Just wanted to get this off my chest, if you'll pardon my choice of words!"
solstice-spices,1532471850,"Hello. I'm newly diagnosed 45yo IDC less than 7mm. Er/PR + Her2 - 
Having the genetic test done in a few days. If genetic test is positive, surgeon says bilateral mastectomy and ovary removal. If test is negative, I have to choose between lumpectomy or mastectomy. I own a small business and worry about time away from work. Wondering if any of you could share how your recovery was from bilateral mastectomy? Several weeks? Months?"
pudding84,1532451627,"...and I have some questions, for those who've been there/are there. First off, I am 34/f, and my breast cancer is IDC (invasive ductal carcinoma). Stage is 2b. I was diagnosed on June 25th, but did a cycle of IVF first (to make/freeze embryos as my husband and I have not yet had children and we didn't want to close that door just yet - my egg retrieval is tomorrow morning), so my treatment was put off slightly until July 27th.

My chemo is the AC-Taxol regime; 4 sessions of AC, two weeks apart, followed by 4 sessions of Taxol, two weeks apart - so, roughly 4 months. This will be followed by a lumpectomy to remove what's left of the tumour, if anything. 

One thing I am having EXTREME anxiety about is the nausea, particularly on the AC chemo. I've always had anxiety about nausea, and have always been concerned about getting cancer  my whole life BECAUSE of the nausea (obviously, worrying about dying is up there too, but oddly, not as high as feeling sick to my stomach and vomiting!). Whenever I get nauseous, I start having panic attacks and usually will pop 1 - 2 Gravol immediately. I can't stand it. I feel like the walls start caving in around me and I can't breathe. Now, I will be on a variety of drugs and I can continue to take Gravol, and I've been assured that the drugs are much better than they used to be, but I'm still very, very concerned they won't work ENOUGH. 

So, my first question is: If you were on AC-Taxol, how bad was your nausea, how long would it last, and what drugs were you on to help alleviate it?

Second question: I got a big binder from the cancer centre, and part of it was detailing all the complications that could go happen with chemo. I was wondering how many people (regardless of the type of chemo), had any complications, such as infections or blood clots? They say these can be common, but so far, I don't know of too many people who've had anything, personally. Just wanted to check in here."

Greasy_Mandingo,1532386211,"My mom had been biopsied last week and found out today that her tumor is 9 mm. It is cancerous and they told her that they would need to remove the first line of Lymph nodes. They didn't give her a stage, do they not know until they remove the lymph nodes? She asked if it was metastasized and they said no. They didn't expand any on that. Would they be able to know that yet? I was really hoping the details would be more definitive.. "
Greasy_Mandingo,1532266566,"From what I understand my mom (42) had a lump in her breast. It seems to be attached, painless, and hard. I've heard these are all bad precursors. She described it as oblong and kind of ""fingery""? (I think has fibrous tissue coming off it?) 

She has had the MRI, some other screenings, now she is waiting on the results of her Biopsy. I may be getting ahead of myself but I just feel helpless if I'm not accumulating more information. 

So my question is (I'll edit in more specifics as I find them out) are the characteristics of the lump pretty definitive that it's not a cyst or fibroadenoma? Does the fact that its attached or ""fingery"" mean it's more likely to have spread? Would there be other symptoms or signs if she had more advanced breast cancer? 

I really appreciate any information, other stories I have read on here seem mostly hopeful and I appreciate so much that you share your stories and experiences."

I have hardly been able to sleep since I found it and am super nervous about my mammogram appointment tomorrow. The lymph node under the left side of jaw feels super swollen. I know I should just wait for the doctor, but I'm freaking out a bit. Are there any other symptoms with breast cancer in men? I don't have any discharge or anything. Thanks in advance."
SaggingMammaries,1532106003,"Hi.  My GF was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer last august.  She did chemo, surgery, and radiation.   The doc is now putting her on Aromotose Inhibitor/Arimidex/Anastrazole with Lupron.  \*\*FOR SEVEN GOD DAMN YEARS\*\*  


This will force her into menopause.   Last year has been utter hell with negativity, mood swings, abusive behavior.  Is there anything else she can do?   All my research says this drug is for post menopausal women, not women who are 36.  I don't want her to be a constant bitch, call me names, and not want to do anything.  I don't want her body to change, I don't want her hair to fall out, I don't want her to gain wait, I don't want her libido to be gone (it's already been gone a fucking year).  


Is there anything else she can do instead to keep her horemones?   Anything?!   Because this fucking sucks.  I  don't want to be selfish but I don't know if I can do this.  This last year was the worst year of my life.   I am constantly miserable because she is constantly miserable.   This is not the way I wanted to live my life.  I miss being care free, her being horny, wanting to do activities, and being super active.   The way she has been the past year has been the complete opposite; it's like she's a different person.   Please don't flame me for this perspective, she has a great support network, but fuck.  This sucks.  She's supposed to be on this shit for SEVEN motherfucking years!??!?!

Fuck."
LexC29,1532103867,"Hi All,

I posted here a while ago. I have a small lump in my right beast. In May, an X-Ray determined, based on my doctors opinion, that it is benign. She wants to see me in September, then again in December for another X ray to confirm ""everything is still the same"". 

I am wondering if I should push to just have it removed, rather than haul myself to her office/the breast centre every 3 months to monitor it. 

When I got my initial X Ray i accepted that it was benign, I got busy with my sisters wedding and didn't have time to get it removed. Now that my life has quieted down, do any of you think it would be worth getting removed and biopsied just to be 100%  sure? I've read and heard of cancer being missed in young women because we don't fit the profile. Mostly, I was talking to my best friend who is a doctor and she suggested I get it out. It has just re kindled some anxiety I had pushed away. 

Thanks! "

My wife was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, but we don’t have any of the details yet…that will come out when we meet with the surgical oncologist on Friday.  So at this point we have no idea what stage it is or what her prognosis looks like.  We’re trying our best to stay positive and not to go down mental rabbit holes focusing on possible worst case scenarios but it’s hard.  I know some level of fear and anxiety is completely normal but at the same time, I want us both to be able to enjoy life…now and after we receive whatever the prognosis ends up being.

she’s 22 and in good health, but with very possible PCOS that is getting a checkup. 
it’s a small, pea sized bump on her breast, left side, near the armpit. it’s red bc she’s tried to squeeze it to see if it’s a cyst, which she gets often in other places around. it seems hard, and almost rooted in. she can move it, it’s just ... there. can not find any similar pictures online. 
NO PAIN, no swelling, no other symptoms except it being there. it’s been over 6 months since it’s appeared with no changes. could it be a cyst or something else? will update when we go to the docs but i just wanna give her some semblance of peace from people who’ve gone through this. don’t know if this post is ok to make, but god we appreciate it if you have any information. thank you "

Radicallocket,1531521755,"I posted probably a month or so ago and I have a couple more questions.
My ultrasound came back with extremely dense breast tissue and they were not able to see the lump but able to feel it. Since I was breastfeeding at the time they told me to stop and to come back in 3 months but in all honesty I mentally can't wait that long.

Has anyone been breastfeeding and got a mammogram and nothing show up or cause it to obstruct the view?
Should I wait the 3 months?

I obviously have a lot of stress and anxiety over this to where I just want answers instead of being stuck in limbo.

Thank you

anonslap,1531498139,"I'm not sure if this is allowed but I'm not sure where else to post. I didn't see any community rules? 

To start, I'm a 23/F with a history of cancer in my family. My great aunt had breast and my grandma had ovarian, my uncle had pancreatic and my sister had skin cancer. My uncle had lung cancer but he was also a smoker. I do have an appointment with my GYN on the 2nd of August and an appointment with a breast surgeon on the 8th of August. I'm concerned because I've seen both of these people before and have been given no answers other than ""typical, dense, lumpy breast tissue.""

About a year ago, I noticed a lump in my right breast slightly above the nipple.  I went to my GYN and had her look at it and she scheduled an ultrasound.  The ultrasound came up with nothing?  They didn't even see any sort of mass however it is very palpable.  I feel it most when I'm sitting up and it's the size of about a marble.  

A few months later, I felt like it had gotten a bit bigger and so I went back to my GYN and she agreed that it was more palpable than last time. So she referred me to a breast specialist. The breast specialist reassured me at the time that if the lump had been there for a year and remained relatively unchanged, it most likely wasn't cancerous. He did another ultrasound and again, came up with nothing.  He, however, wasn't able to feel what I am feeling?  He said that the fact that I could feel the lump when sitting up and not when laying down is a good sign because it is most likely just clumped up breast tissue.

Well a few weeks ago I noticed the lump was more pronounced than it had been before (to cope with my constant anxiety about this I pretty much tried to avoid looking/touching my breasts at all for a few weeks).  I laid down and felt where the lump is and now I can *definitely* feel it lying down where as I wasn't able to before.

And *now* I am feeling a weird spot on the other side of my nipple.  It's quite large so I'm inclined to think it could be due to caffiene consumption or something harmless.  However, for the last few weeks, my right nipple has been really sensitive.  It's uncomfortable to wear a bra, it's uncomfortable to not wear one, and touching it is just extremely strange feeling.  It's like there's a tender spot directly behind my nipple.  When I press down, it kind of zings all the way into my back and aches all over my right breast.  I also keep finding these little scratches on my breast which seem to show up out of nowhere.  They aren't really anywhere where the wire of my bra could be poking me or anything?  That may or may not be related but that's also been happening.  The skin of my areola is kind of itchy and getting a little scaly looking which is also a new development.

My left breast feels totally normal.  No lumps and bumps, no tenderness.  My right breast is noticeably larger than the left but I can't say with confidence that it hasn't always been that way.  I don't remember noticing it before last year but I also never paid much attention to my breasts until I noticed something abnormal. 

Anyway, I don't know what I'm looking for exactly I'm just kind of freaking out.  I feel like something is going on and I've had at least four ultrasounds in the last year and they've all come back blank.  The breast surgeon doesn't even seem to feel anything unusual even though I very clearly do.  This tenderness isn't normal and these lumps have absolutely not always been there."

It's draining me and driving me crazy. I want to be there for her. I give her all my free time after work but I really dread seeing her. 9 out of 10 times I'm with her we end up having quarrels. I feel bad for being in quarrels with her but she always ends up starting a stupid fight over nothing. And I can't help but defend myself. I'm just always shoved into a corner.

Hospital received referral told us give them a couple of days for the doctor to go over everything.  And that the hospital would call us to schedule.  I asked for a rough timeframe of when we would get that call and was told sometime late this week.

That’s our timeline so far.  She has not been sent to the surgeon or had any testing.  She only has the referral to the oncologist.

My plan is to call up the hospital next Friday the 13th to ask about the status of the referral if we have not heard back from them by then.

CancerSurvivorship,1530601882,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

So, I found this out yesterday, I'm pretty poor at emotions and the like. So I mostly just shut down. I feel selfish. I am pretty scared. So far we don't really know anything, just that she has surgery on Thursday and will probably be home by Sat, and then we wait two weeks for results from that before knowing what the plan is with chemo and radiotherapy. 

I know everyone's recovery is different, but I really think she is trying to soften it for us, which I understand. Telling me to just be around on Saturday and then go back home on Sunday. I feel like this is a massive surgery, she is getting reconstruction done at the same time. I just want to be realistic and be able to take the time off work ( I live a few hours away and can't drive ) to be able to care for her. It is likely that she won't be able to do anything at all for about 4 - 6 weeks right? She is fit and healthy in general. 

Has anyone gone through this? What should I expect, obviously making food, taking care of house things that is all pretty clear to me. But other things, will she be able to move at all? Will she be able to walk up stairs? I feel like we kind of know what to expect with chemo, but I think the recovery from the surgery is going to worse than we expect. "

When you turn 40 you're supposed to get your first mammogram but I skipped my yearly pap smear last year so I didn't get a mammogram either. I didn't go because I didn't want to. I hate going to the doctor's office. They always take your blood pressure and mine is always high at the doctor's office because I hate going to any kind of doctor for any reason. 

Anyway after that, I got a phone call from the office and they had scheduled an appointment for me at a different office for additional testing.  The reason given was that I had dense tissue and no prior mammograms to compare to and I should go in and have additional screenings. So I wasn't too phased by that, and I went to that appointment without any fear.

So I found out that I have six tumors. I had to sign a form that stated that I had tumors that were probably not cancerous but I should go back in six months for more tests.

The person who reviewed my images said that the tumors I had appeared to be benign and of the sort that never metastasize.  I was also told that they'd seen a patient who had 13 of similar looking tumors and they were very reassuring. 

But I'm going back in six months.

My aunt had breast cancer and she went through a double masectomy and chemotherapy and was cleared of her breast cancer but within a year she had pancreatic cancer and that killed her.

My coworker had breast cancer and she got a masectomy and chemotherapy, and was cleared to go back to work but then she was diagnosed with leukemia, had a bone marrow transplant that was reported to be successful but then she took a sudden turn for the worse and died.  She died bald with a swollen head because her hair never grew back.

So, just curious, should I be worried about six benign tumors?

Fast forward to today, I found a grape-sized, oval shaped lump in the same exact location. It’s smooth, firm, and rubbery feeling— feels exactly like a grape is under my skin. I don’t have any of the “classic” BC symptoms that pop up when you google it— just the lump.

NoPerspective2,1529095106,My armpit is also feeling tender.
Firstbornkern,1528948795,"In 2016 (34yrs old) I had a sharp breast pain that never left. No lump could be felt, it just hurt. I gave it a few months, and no change. I went to the dr who scheduled a mammogram and an ultrasound. 

I received a letter in the mail, shortly after, informing me that I have extremely dense breasts and the results were inconclusive. I figured my physician would let me know if needed anything else, and I just moved on. 

In 2018, my mom was diagnosed with stage 0 cancer and got a lumpectomy and in a conversation she brought up the state mandated letters being sent because dense breast tissue can hide cancers. 

Uh oh.. I messed up. I should have followed up. so I make an appointment again with my provider. Pains the same, so I get an mri with contrast. 

The dr calls me 6 hours after the mri, which freaked me out. The radiologists report says benign mass found in the painful breast and to get a mammogram and ultrasound..

Why would I loop back around? What makes it benign? So many questions. My physician also wanted more information and tried to reach the radiologist but he had left for the day. So we wait..

Any insight? "
myredditusernameisnt,1528818674,"Hi all, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago my wife [42] noticed that her left breast was getting larger than the other. After a quick visit to the doctor, who found a number of lumps, she has been referred to the Churchill for screening. It’s become really obvious over the last few weeks. 
We started measuring and it’s getting bigger by about an inch a week. 

My questions are
1. What should we expect on Thursday? She’s not letting come into the room with her. 
2. What should / could I do to support her? 

Thanks  "
CancerSurvivorship,1528742088,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part.

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20\-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

ugh_sorry,1528675691,"The title says it all, i'm quite new to reddit and i never thought i would have to be worried about a topic like this:(
My grandmothers from both sides had a history of cancer one of them had a really bad type of breast cancer, but i don't know many details as i'm not close with my family.

I'm 22 but not sure how age effects my chances. I will have a surgery because of the fibroadenoma in my right breast next week. Doctors in my country doesn't really tell me anything, and i don't know anyone who has similar experiences. Should i be worried as i found another lump but this case its under my jaw and it actually hurts more than the one in my breast?

Also, what impact will these things have on my future? Where should i start actual research in this topic to try to prevent something more serious? I honestly feel so lost and have been just ignoring it but i really wanna do my best."
BlackWidow4G,1528660561,"44 yrs old, I had a fibroadenoma in my right breast 3.5 yrs ago, and after a biopsy they recommended taking it out because of a small chance it could be a phyllodes tumor (dr was 90% sure it was a fibroadenoma which it was). Now I have another lump on my left breast, and due to moving and new insurance I saw a different doctor on Friday. After feeling it she said it definitely feels like a fibroadenoma, ordered an ultrasound and mammogram (I just had a routine mammo 5 months ago that was clear). She said they may want to do a biopsy depending on how the ultrasound comes out. My question is, given my age and the fact that this is my 2nd lump in 3 years, why wouldn’t they do a biopsy off the bat? A mammogram and ultrasound will just confirm that the mass is there, right? I feel the mammogram is unnecessary and just want to get it biopsied. This doctor was also a bit dismissive, and said “you don’t have to get a fibrodenoma removed.” I am leaning heavily towards just taking it out given my age. 

Family history: maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her late 40’s and had a mastectomy with no return of cancer (lived to be 96). Neither my mom nor my 3 aunts have had BC so I’m not considered super high risk but I do have dense breast tissue. "
Prutzle,1528528493,"Hi all!

I really hope I'll be able to get out of this sub within a week or so, but now that I'm in the middle of the waiting stage I feel the need to share with people who get it.   

I'm 30, mom of a 20 month old boy and we're looking to try for kid #2. Which is why I finally figured I had to see my GP. I've had a lump in my right breast for a while (4\-5 months at least, probably longer) but shook it off as breastfeeding weirdness. It's growing a little, though. I don't want to find out it's 'something' when pregnant (or preferably never!) so I went to get the 'it's nothing!' from my GP.  

She referred me for a mammography (after reading more \- that seems that be step 1 if you're after 30 \- but as I'm breastfeeding I'm not sure it's necessary/very useful. Perhaps an ultrasound would make more sense?). The hospital in my city would have me wait 3 weeks. Luckily insurance is fine anywhere, so now I'll be seen on Monday (within 3 working days, instead of 3 weeks!).     


\- Lump is \~1 cm, oval shaped. Can move, doesn't hurt.   

\- GP didn't feel anything in my armpit.   

\- Still breastfeeding \- I've had mastitis last year and they did an ultrasound at that time.  (Can't recall which breast that was...)  

I don't know of anyone in my family who had breast cancer. However, I did do a 23andme last year and have my raw DNA data. I don't have the 3 big BRCA genes 23andme test for, but I do have at least one bad mutation in the BRCA2 group (you can analyse your raw data via other websites). And some other mutations that increase risk for ovarian and breast cancer. I'll be sure to let my doctors know about that. (I only found out about the BRCA2 because I searched for it specifically after getting the referral).   

Obviously, my mind is going all sorts of places. I'm happy I have a funeral insurance, thinking of not ever being able to have more kids (doom scenarios, much!). I'm an information hoarder so I'm just trying to accept that part of who I am and go with the flow. Telling me to stay off Google or reddit is not going to help, so instead I'm trying to learn as much as I can. Best case I learn a lot of new stuff that might someday help me support others, worst case scenario I'm already up to scratch on some of the lingo and can go into whatever comes that much more prepared.

floridagar,1528490631,"I'm absolutely furious at these (Vancouver) ""practitioners"". She's been giving them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and is now at the point where she is missing actual appointments because her back pain is so severe. 

My wife is currently taking care of her and has been telling me some of the ""treatments"" they're selling her and when I look them up every one of them is dubious at best but primarily they are utter horseshit. 

A short incomplete list:
 
*photon sound wave - allegedly to ""devitalize"" and get her cells all on the same frequency

*vitamin drips - they take hours and cost thousands

*hyperbaric treatments - putting her in a pressurized chamber

*various ""herbs and spices""

*dietary restrictions and supplements

They started a gofundme yesterday which has -amazingly- already  collected more than $10k because she's such a well loved beautiful person. I'm afraid a large part of this money will end up in the hands of these snake oil salesmen when they find out about it.

I don't know what to do but I had to leave this somewhere. Its possible they didn't do any real harm but they told her they've cured cases like hers and I'm afraid they might've caused her to allow the window for real treatment (read: actual medicine) to close as the last time she saw a real doctor they told her chemo is no longer an option when before it was ""we will not do surgery until you've done chemo"". 

I'm so angry I'm in tears. Is there no legislation in place to protect vulnerable patients from salesmen like this? The products they sell should require a disclaimer stating ""This product will not cure cancer"".

I know some people find emotional comfort in these alternative treatments, some of them might have an effect, placebos can be very powerful etc so I don't want to offend anybody.

Please just someone say something. 

Thank you.

hayley-trask,1528404288,I have recently had a bilateral mastectomy and tissue expanders put into place. I am worried about capsular contracture on my breast that was previously radiated. There are already spots that are indented and very hard in that breast only a few days after surgery. Is there any way to reduce this risk and/or reverse it?

Its been about a month since I went in and discussed treatment options with my team - surgeon, oncologist, and radiologist. All indicated that the lumpectomy with radiation was the standard of care that they recommended, but I'm terrified of the radiation process.  I honestly can't read anymore blog posts or studies - it's too overwhelming.  So now I'm here asking others who've been through this - how did you decide what to do? "

I'm 36yrs old with 2 young daughters. I went to have a lump that I found checked out. 
Ultrasound lead to Mammogram, that lead to another long ultrasound, and the radiologist coming in the room to tell me that she was certain what she was seeing was breast cancer and offered to biopsy it right then and there. I was alone. But I said of course. Do it. I will be forever grateful for a radiologist who went above and beyond, even giving me her cell number and speaking to me on the phone as I drove home. I am a nurse and had just gotten off a night shift. 
6 days later it was confirmed that I had IDC. 
I'm in this weird twilight zone right now. More testing and diagnostics. Finalizing surgery dates. I am Er/Pr + my her2 was sent for FISH and is still pending. That will determine my need for chemo. All lymph and axillary nodes look normal from MRI. My largest lesion measuring 1.2cm. 
I'm still on the fence about my surgical route. And awaiting because tests results. I have a follow-up with my surgical team on Friday to finalize and move forward. 
The hardest part has been how lonely and dark these days have been. I have an amazing support system, but none of them are 36yrs old with breast cancer. I don't even have any Breast Cancer in my family! And had zero risk factors. So anyone reading this, who is young and newly diagnosed with breast cancer. You're not alone. These are dark days.

LeftBoobsAreOverated,1528241085,"I'm 30 and keep telling myself there's no way I can have breast cancer, but so many of you are so young that I feel I may be misguided about the likelihood of getting breast cancer before 50.

I have a grape sized lump on my left breast on the inside of my breast. It is solid and it doesn't move or hurt, from my research all of this is bad news. 

I have a consultation with a boob Dr. scheduled for Thursday, they require the consultation before they do the biopsy which is frustrating. I really just want to get to the point and know if it's cancer or not.

Over the past two weeks I've noticed a little pain under and to my right side of my nipple. Tonight I did some deep touching and noticed that there is something under the skin, almost oval shaped and slightly flat, maybe 2 inches wide and 1 inch in height. It's fairly soft, and moves around a bit. It's tender not painful. 

I'm 32, male, in decent shape, how does this happen? This is something, even if it's not cancer, something is growing. I'm not sick, I don't have any infections. It's either cancer, a benign tumor, or I'm growing a boob, like and actual boob. 

It definitely makes you rethink life decisions that's for sure.

pixie_16,1528127094,"Hi there,

It's been 10 years since I discovered I had breast cancer (right breast, not metastasized). Had a breast amputation, chemo, radiation and 2 y later a breast reconstruction with belly tissue and belly fat.
Since 7y ago I developed lymphedema in my right arm. I have physical therapy 2x/ week, wear an arm sleeve (but am not always consistent, not so easy always to endure it), and try to avoid strenuous exercise for the right arm or lifting too heavy stuff.
But I still have a difference in circumference of 9 cm between both arms. And it hurts bad some days, to the point I can't sleep or feel my fingers. 

I heard of an new kind of operation performed where I live (Belgium), where they connect the ""ducts"" (don't know the right word) that transfer the lymphe fluid to a blood vessel in your arm so that the fluid can evacuate from your arm. 
But I can't seem to find much people who already had this kind of surgery...
Maybe anybody here has had this operation or knows someone who has? I'd love to know how that went and if they had improvement?

Greetings from Belgium x"
codecowboy,1528090372,"My wife has been battling breast cancer on and off for 29 years.  She had it in 1989.  It came back in 2012 in the airway between the lungs.  In 2016 it came back in her spine, hip, and liver.   We have exhausted all pill form endocrine therapy.  So tomorrow she is having a port installed.    Crappy infusion style chemo starts this Friday. 

What sucks is she is doing this merely to buy time.  Her condition is now considered ""chronic"".  That seems to be the politically correct way of saying terminal.  She retired on June 1st to focus on this fight.  She's got things to do still.  Our son is getting married in October and she wants to see that.   After that....then decisions will be made if the chemo is worth continuing.  It just depends on how this Summer goes.   ""Quality over Quantity"" has been our motto this go round."
CF_anon,1527972704,"Hi, all. I'm 28. I was back in my home state and noticed that for 2 days my left nipple would not stop itching. It did stop after 2 days, and I went back home - I noticed 3 days ago (would have been about 2 days after the itching) that I had a small pink/red (pimple-size but not raised) on the very edge of my areola on my left boob.

It looks like a bug bite, but again, it's not raised. There's no rash, my skin does not feel hot, the texture is normal. The business I work for is in my home state, which neighbors the current state I live in now. We have to visit every month, and my health insurance is still in my home state, so I have to drive 4 hours for appointments.

voodoopdx,1527930541,"I'm 28 and my mother was diagnosed today. I'm still really processing the news, but I imagine my thoughts and feelings pale in comparison to what she's going through...

It puts a lot on my mind though. She's always had illness issues and rheumatoid arthritis and a host of mental issues including severe depression, bipolar, and drug addiction.

Essentially we've never really gotten along due to a lot of factors but I've always loved her and tried and tried again to be a part of her life. I'm now 28 years old and recently, for the first time, was able to connect with her and start building a relationship.

Sadly, she and my boyfriend got into it one day and she handled it in the same way she does most things in my life: light it on fire and watch it burn. So we ended up moving a short distance away from my home town to get some distance and try again at a relationship without living right next to one another.

My mother is an addict... But she has a big heart. She is a hard working woman, a suffering woman. She has been sexually assaulted, homeless, near death the addiction she had was so bad, and even close to dying from the various illnesses that have plagued her most of my adult life.

I have loved her with all of my heart, and I have despised her with every fiber of my being at various times.

And after four weeks of distance from the emotions and anger that we all had in our recent interaction, I was at peace with knowing the road ahead was still possible to build that relationship one day at a time.

And then suddenly, this past week, my mom woke up and had a large inch and a half by two inch lump in her breast. It was painful she said. Then she noticed a hard lump on her neck that same day, behind her ear. Then a lump on her head.

At first, we thought this was probably an infection, or maybe a cyst situation gone astray. Troublesome indeed, but not earth shattering. She'd go to the doctor when she could find time off work, it was decided, and all would be well.

I had a feeling something just wasn't right. Sure, the lump moved a bit. Sure l, it was painful, which is not typical. And sure the lump was sudden and large. Not to mention other areas of the body showing the same rapidly appearing odd changes.

I told her I'd feel happier if she'd take time off work that day and go to urgent care for a quick check up. 

And so she did. The tests came back, the doctor called personally with the initial results. The lump does not contain fluid... It is most assuredly cancer, he said, and it was important a more thorough diagnostic was completed as soon as possibly could be scheduled. 

The other locations, the doctor informed us, were indicative that this was either a cancer that has spread to her breast, and other locations, or more likely is a stage iv breast cancer scenario that has been rapid in developing. My mom was religious about being aware of her body and checked herself for any breast changes every single day. 

Suddenly her body was different. Suddenly it wasn't the same one she had known for 49 years. And suddenly this complicated person in my life, who fills me with rage and love, disappointment and pride, pain and triumphant joy, this person who I admire and pity... This person who I regard as both the best person I have ever known and the worst person I've ever known. Suddenly this person has become the center of my universe... 

And I don't know how to deal...I lost my father 6 years ago to suicide... And now from the timelines discussed with my mother and I, it is likely I will lose my mom before I'm thirty. Her immune system isn't very strong due to ramicade infusions for her arthritis so the outlook is fairly grim regardless of cancer type. 

My little brother is seven. If anything happens to my mom... Suddenly Im not just big brother anymore. So I'm processing this idea, and it's emotionally suffocating on top of the existing layer. 

There's so much happening around me right now, and in no way am I the one suffering most. But at the end of the day, I am suffering. And the pain is tremendous, regardless of my mixed emotions about her. 

She may be the reason for some of my worst memories in life. But she is also the focus of many of the best.  And I always imagined her being around, at least until I reached middle age and my brother was graduated from a college with fancy degree from somewhere he could always be proud of. And she'd be there for him like she never was for me because she is devoted to her second chance as a mother. Her way of making up for the mistakes of her past with me was to do right by him and show me she learned about being a mother through confronting that pain she created. 

But that progress will be cut short. I will be there for this woman I never truly understood but who loved me in her own way, as best she could. But soon, she will no longer be there for me, or my family, or her friends. I'm just...

Emotional tonight. 

I wanted to say something somewhere safe so that I can get all that out. Thank you guys for listening. 

TL;DR: My mom and I have a very strained relationship and her new cancer diagnosis has made me confront a lot of emotions all at once.

1. What are the top three things that people say to you when the find out that you have cancer that you find/found annoying?
2. What were the top three things that were funny to you \(and maybe nobody else \) during treatment?
3. What are the top three misconceptions people have about you post treatment?
4. And for the caregivers of those that fought the brave battles but didn't make it...what would be the top three things that they would want us to know about their journey.

I realize these topics can and will be uncomfortable to share and I will feel extraordinarily blessed for those that feel that they can.

I want to be able to speak to and advocate for those that don't feel comfortable speaking out but want the message to be shared with those that will appreciate it.

Love to all"

When shopping for a prosthetic, what are some materials you generally lean towards?Are you for silicone prosthetics, or poly-fiber? How easy is the process of going through your insurance to help cover the costs? Thank you in advance!"
the_real_dairy_queen,1526668771,"Lately I have been feeling a random ache in my left breast. It actually feels kind of like when I was lactating and I’d go too long without nursing, but not quite because that was a kind of pressure and fullness and this feels more like tenderness or like I have a deep bruise. 

Last night I rolled onto that breast while in bed and it felt like I had a bouncy ball in my breast - something hard. I felt my breast and I felt a hard lump deep inside, against the muscle wall. But it’s kind of lumpy in there in general? My right one doesn’t feel lumpy. 

I made an appt for a mammogram and the scheduler seemed concerned when I talked about the pain and lump. She said to get a referral for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, not a screening mammogram. 

My husband was looking up my symptoms and stumbled upon info about fibrocystic breasts. It seems like it could be that, but I really have no idea. 

Just wondering if anyone is out there who has similar pain with a tumor or fibrocystic breasts. Really not sure whether to be terrified right now. 😔"

remembertheporter,1526540460,"I don't really know where else to go with this. 
My mom finally went to the doctor after experiencing fatigue, chest pain, and bronchitis that just wouldn't go away.
Initially, the doc found a small cancerous tumor in her breast and the lymph node near her armpit. She walked out with a Stage 2b diagnosis. She mentioned the chest pain, so they ordered a pet scan and found a small tumor just near her breast bone.
 She didn't tell me if it was in her bone or lymph node. It's hard to get her to be honest about what the doctors are saying. She's trying to protect me and my sister.
 My Dad has been obsessively Googling cancer lifespans and assumes its spread to her bone and that she has Stage 4. He says she has years, not decades. He isn't sleeping, and his behavior worries me more than my Mom's.
My real questions are: is it possible that the pet scan could have just found the other tumor in her chest was  in her lymph node, not her bone?
Will stage 4 really give me less than five years with my mom?
She's my person and the idea of not having her hurts too much.

I do have lumpy, dense breasts. But whenever I google pictures of breast tumor on mammogram, it looks exactly like mine.

CancerSurvivorship,1526289403,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

As a thank you for your time, we will enter you into a prize draw where you could win a £50 Amazon voucher, or even an iPad Mini.

Thank you,

confusedBadger25,1526264936,"TLDR: What stage is a TNM of pT2(m)pN1(sn) with a multifocal IDC size of 2.2CM and 1.1CM Grade 2 with DCIS of 3.3CM Grade 3 and two lymph nodes involved?

-------------

My Mom had a lumpectomy about two weeks ago for breast cancer and recently received the final biopsy and staging results.

The paper the surgeon gave her states that the TMN is pT2(m)pN1(sn), and I am extremely confused as too what the actual number stage of the cancer is. Since when looking online gives different results for what these numbers mean.

To give a little more information:
The tumor was mutlifocal IDC with one area being 2.2CM(Grade 2) and the other one was 1.1CM. With a large area of DCIS(3.3CM, Grade 3) in-between the tumors themselves.

One lymph node had been heavily spread to (1.3CM) and the second had only a small amount of cancer cells (0.1CM). The third lymph node did not have any cancer cells.

She is triple positive for ER/PR and HER2.

I am confused on the actual staging because for instance, [looking on the Susan G. Komen table](https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/StagingofBreastCancer.html), in the T2N1 area checking both G2 and G3 (because I am not really sure which one I should be following) and the triple positive areas; the table shows stage 1B. The most interesting thing I have found when researching staging is the second example on [this site](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/stages-of-breast-cancer.html) says that cancer that is a larger size and with more lymph nodes then what my mom biopsy showed is still 1B.

But like [this one](https://cancerstaging.org/references-tools/quickreferences/Documents/BreastMedium.pdf) and other places says the staging is stage 2B.

My Dad asked what the stage was, but I think he kind of asked a leading question that because lymph nodes were involved that made it Stage 2 and I am sure that the surgeon see a lot of people (not to how many did the surgeon see before my mom's appointment) and could have possibly gotten confused about things.

Has anyone else know someone with a similar diagnosis and can let me know what the stage is? I would like to know because I know the treatment between stage 1 and 2 is very different and I would hate to see my mom go through treatment that wasn't necessary.

Thank you for reading!"
LilBurritoFeet,1526177367,"Hey all, I'm new here. Just got diagnosed on Thursday (triple negative receptor, stage 3, right breast, 4.5cm lump, awaiting my BRCA results) and am getting a chemo port put in on Monday to start chemo very soon.

I am 31 years old, have one 15 month old son and am 24 weeks pregnant (Due 8/31/18) with a second baby. I have done some research about what's to come but I am also just trying to take everything one day at a time because my anxiety takes me to terrible places. Anyway. I was told I would start very soon on AC chemo (sorry if some of my terms are incorrect, I was at doctors office all yesterday and it was very surreal so still sorting things out). 

I was told that I would stop chemo about 6 weeks before delivery and then I would start up after the baby arrives to finish out my treatment. I have read a little bit about chemo and I know that I will not be able to breastfeed.

I was wondering about bed sharing though. I read that you have to be cautious after the chemo treatments (flushing twice, washing sheets if any bodily fluids get on it, etc) but I wondered is bed sharing allowed? Are the chemicals so intense that this might harm a newborn and/or my toddler son? I'm trying to find answers here so I can prepare myself for what's to come. I will be attending a chemo info session this coming week but I  would love to hear from women who have been through this and I guess just hear some feedback. I'm not interested in opinions about the safety of bed sharing overall, strictly about the potential affects to a newborn and potentially my toddler son. 

Also interested in any other topics that maybe I'm not thinking about in regards to doing all of this with a newborn and toddler.

Thank you all for listening :)"

After two mammograms I had a biopsy today because of a small cluster of calcification. I passed out right as he finished and then I didn’t stop bleeding for 45 minutes. I’m feeling a bunch of emotions that I’m having trouble dealing with. What helped you until you got the results? They said probably Tuesday.
codecowboy,1526071369,"Is it just me or do doctors offices seem to be staffed by incompetent or just uncaring staff these days.  I know I""m generalizing and there are exceptions, but we have not been doing well lately.  

My wife has stage IV metastatic breast cancer that has spread to six vertebrae, her right hip, and her liver.  She has been given a terminal diagnosis and are just buying time.  We like her oncologist, but the staff are really starting to piss me off.  I just had to read them the riot act.  For the fourth time in the last few months we have called in because of issues she's been having.   Dizziness, fever, whatever.  We have to leave a message around 9am because they are so busy.  Then the nurse does not listen to the messages till after 5pm when it's too late to do anything.  They MAYBE call us back the next day anywhere from 9 am to 5pm and say they will talk to the doctor.  Then nothing.  This is bullshit.  We called on Tuesday and left a message.  We called back on Wednesday and they said they would talk to the doctor.  We called back on Thursday and had to leave another message, but heard nothing.  This morning I started blowing up their phones at 9am.  A nurse and a office manager were informed of just how annoyed I was and how unacceptable this was.

If you work for a oncologist anything less than your first rate ""A"" game is unacceptable.   If I don't do my job for 48 hours you won't have your email.  If they don't do their job for 48 hours someone could die.   If I call in because my on chemo cancer patient wife is running a low grade fever this is not something you can put off for 3 to 5 days.  Twenty four hours is the MOST I would find acceptable.   It could be nothing, or it could kill her.  "
LexC29,1526058203,"Like many posts on here, I am waiting for my ultrasound. I found a small lump two weeks ago while randomly feeling my breasts, and my doctor confirmed it was about 1cm. Told me not to worry, but is sending me for an ultrasound. The breast centre at the hospital near my office is wonderful, but it also means I have to wait until May 25. My doc has booked my results follow up for June 4th so all in all, It'll be a month before I know anything definite!!! 

I am lucky to live in Canada, and Toronto specifically which has amazing  hospitals, but The wait is awful, but I am trying to keep myself busy and active so I don't sit here and think of it. Just wanted to vent my fears in hopes of finding people going through the same waiting game. "
tommys-mommy,1525924866,"I’m 29 and had my annual yesterday. I went in expecting a relatively quick and straightforward appt that would lead to a refill of my birth control. During the breast exam portion, I noticed my doc spending more time palpating  than usual, and when she busted out a tape measure, I knew in my gut what she was going to say next. And I didn’t actually hear much of what she had to say. My reptilian brain took over.

Here’s the little that I know:
-It is roughly 4 cm on my left breast at ~10 o’clock 
-It’s slightly tender to the touch
-No skin dimpling, nipple discharge, discoloration, or other notable symptoms
-I am scheduled for an ultrasound and bilateral mammogram in 6 days

My doc told me to not lose any sleep over it. Ha! My mind and body totally did not heed that advice. I’m terrified and struggling with the uncertainty and the waiting. This may very well be a fibroadenoma, or it may not be. I just don’t know, and I hate that I don’t know.

Any suggestions on what I can do to cope over the next couple of weeks of diagnostic procedures? How have you dealt with the waiting?

paranoidaf01,1525867412,"I am 16 years old, birthday is in two months. Around 2 years old my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was a very tuff and stressful year for myself, my two siblings, my dad and all of our close family and friends, but we managed and she survived a category 5 breast cancer - both boobs removed due to cancer almost about to break through into the rest of her body and due to the fact her breast cancer was so close to her lungs, heart, throat ect they had to go. Two years later she is cancer free, but I don’t feel like our family is fully cancer free just yet. A few days ago I was at my boyfriends getting changed when I noticed my right boob was in pain so I checked out my boob to see it was leaking clear fluid, after a few wtf moments I squeezed it and then came out milky fluid ....(I’m on birth control too- implant aka the bar) ... my boob decided it was gonna leak for two days and so did my pain but when the leaking stopped my boob became much more pain full. As usual I told my mum she checked for lump but found nothing. The night after I checked because I was in way to much pain, I did it probably, right arm over my head and checked, within a few seconds I found a small lump that every time I pressed on it would aggravate the heck out of my boob and would lead me to tears. I told mum she checked but she couldn’t feel it, as I said it hurt if too much pressure was pressed on it but she wasnt pressing hard enough to be able to find it. I know I wasn’t going crazy and was just feeling my tissue, it was just a lump- hard and very hurt full. All day I’ve had to worst anxiety as I did my research to find I have a high chance at being at risk of it because it’s direct into my family jeans, as well as I’ve had a good 10 or more family members died from it since I was born so it’s just a family thing I guess. My boob is constantly hurting, I feel like I’m going to be sick or even faint at some point. I tried to see a doctor but they were closing. I’m in the group on Facebook called girls advice and I said I was in pain but they only took into consideration that my boob was leaking and how I’m pregnant and them being very rude towards me saying “you have a brain you silly girl, so f***ing use it and get a test” so they didn’t help but I need answers, please someone help me I’m in so much pain....

My breast have stopped growing- as a matter of fact they seem to be getting smaller - due to me loose all this weight so I know it couldn’t be development problems or could it just be that?? 

Pain is only in bottom/right side of my right boob. "

I found a lump in my right breast sometime in mid April, but it was close to my period so I left it alone, fast forward to the week after my cycle and it was still there, so I made an appointment with my obgyn to see what he thought. This morning was the appointment. He told me it was nothing to worry about but then asked if he could remove the fluid with a needle to check the color. Well I said yes, and no fluid came out, just little pieces of tissue that he put on a slide, he punctured it several times. So reading up, I'm seeing that cysts are fluid filled and tumors are not. I'm just super worried too because he said if it was a cyst that it would go away with the aspiration and the lump is still there. Any advice would be appreciated. "

Thanks so much for any replies. 
dontcallmekoko,1524667441,"I think this is the first time I've ever posted on reddit? But I wanted some input from this community.

I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at the age of 24 and my treatment consisted of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. I was then put on Tamoxifen for the next five years. At this point, I've been taking tamoxifen daily for just over two years. Anyway, on to the point of this post:

**I am very curious to know if anyone else has noticed hearing problems either during or after treatment?**

For a little over a year, I've noticed that I have a very hard time hearing people talk. A *very* hard time. I've sort of had this problem for a while: back in high school, I realized that I couldn't really hear what people were saying without my glasses because I apparently read lips a lot lol. This recent struggling is notably different, though, because I've been having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over, sometimes up to four times when I'm just sitting a few feet away from them, with my glasses on. I think when this was a problem around family it was easy to dismiss as nothing, but now that I've finally started working again (for the first time since being diagnosed), I've realized *just* how bad my hearing really is.

There are two other things that alarmed me about my hearing: my headphone use and the volume I use.

My whole life, I've been obsessed with music and that eventually turned into an obsession with headphones. I might have been behind on rent, but I always had at least two pairs of *good* headphones, in-ear and over-ear. I could (and did!) yak on and on about headphones and audio quality for an uncomfortable amount of time. I used to wear my over-ear headphones like a necklace, I couldn't be spotted without a pair for *years.*

And **in the last year, I haven't touched my headphones. I use speakers for everything now--and the volume that I use them at is *really* goddamn loud.**

I used to hate watching or listening to anything on speakers as opposed to headphones and whenever I did, it was always on a relatively low setting. I was sometimes impossible to watch TV with because I always felt the volume was way too high whereas others thought I kept it way too low. And now *I'm* the one with the TV blasting. I didn't notice that until a few months ago, when I kept raising the volume on my TV every few seconds for a few minutes and I finally realized how unnatural that was for me.

Anyway, I provide all this background only because I hope to make it clear that I didn't just spook myself after reading a few articles online. However, I did find a study indicating hearing loss may be worsened by tamoxifen, thus my curiosity peaked. Well... calling it curiosity is kind of sugarcoating it. **To be honest, I had a small breakdown because it just feels like no matter how good you might feel in general, every other month, you keep discovering these new side effects or symptoms or you realize you're *not* back at your full strength after all and... it just makes you feel helpless, like it'll never be over.** The treatment process already took so much from me at this age.. does it really have to take my hearing, too?

**TL;DR** - Fielding the breast cancer reddit community for anecdotes about any hearing loss experienced during or after treatment. I have a feeling it's more common than people know but not really noticed because it's kind of difficult to realize you're suffering from it. If the food you're eating tastes bland, you assume it's the food and not your tastebuds, you know? Not to mention older patients might just assume it's age, younger patients might assume it's related to headphones--which, by the way, this is something I totally acknowledge might be my problem. The reason I think it isn't my headphone use is because I distinctly remember that I originally lessened my headphone usage *during* chemotherapy. And I haven't even mentioned the constant pressure and occasional onsets of sharp pain I've felt in my ears for over a year now.

Anyway, I'm due for an appointment with an ENT doctor next week, I will be sure to update this post then.

My mom (50) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...)

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

Update: 03/10/18 // My mom did another MRI for both breasts. Tumor showed to be bigger. (8 cm) also MRI on the pelvis. Still can't tell if it's cancer or not. Also bone test was done check on density of bones.

Update: 03/19/18 // Oncologist called again. She said after reviewing my moms case with different doctors at the meeting this time, it was suggested to do chemotherapy instead of the pills because they're not still sure if the left iliac pelvis is cancer or not... Three different tests and they still not sure... I told her that were looking for second opinion from different hospital and doctor... Idk what to do anymore.

Update: 03/21/18 // Had a meeting with the oncologist. She went over all the tests and scan results all over again. She said based on the latest MRI test of breasts and whole body. The tumor is 8cm and also shows 4 other lymph nodes cancer positive. Tumor is hormone positive. It has nothing to do with her2 positive or negative. Tumor is also a very low grade. (Grade 1.) Pelvis still is unknown if it's cancer or an age related fracture. Doing biopsy on it wouldn't be so easy because it is an very small area... So the whole plan changed based on the second hospital staff meeting. Now the recommendation is AC-T Chemotherapy FIRST. AC part will be standard 60ml given every 2 weeks x 4 cycles. T part would be once a week for 12 weeks. Then surgery and more likely mastectomy... Then arimidex pill therapy where it can go for 5-10 years... We're on our way for a different doctor and second opinion.

Update: 03/21/18 // Spoke with a different oncologist. This doctor is truly God sent! Right away he asked to get the all the medical records from all different hospitals and doctors... After looking at the most recent exams and tests he said he agrees nor disagrees with the previous oncologist; however, he called a very known radiologist to see if it's possible to do an biopsy on the pelvis bone. And the answer was yes. My mom is scheduled next week for the pelvis biopsy to see if it's cancer or not. Also doctor said to stop with the Anastrozole pills so biopsy results are more accurate. He also ordered an BRCA test. First day my mom didn't take the pill after 2 weeks now...The tumor is 8cm big already. It couldve been growing for a very long time and my mom still physically healthy and young so it wouldn't hurt to put a stop to the pill for little bit to get more accurate results. As of right now my mom is kind of against chemo. I did research as much as I can on what could be done instead of chemo... 

Update: 04/16/18// Spoke with the oncologist again. BRCA test came back negative so that means my mom is not carrying a gene and wasn't passed to her from previous family. Doctor said since my mom is young and in an healthy shape, do the full ACT chemotherapy regimen. That's to shrink down the tumor from 8cm to a reasonable size so with surgery they're able to remove it or possibly a mastectomy since it's big. Now, the tumor is grade 1, has not spreaded anywhere else and it is Estrogen and Progesterone positive. Doctor said since it's not anywhere else in the body, this is the best option and it is curable! My mom is afraid of chemo but now it's two doctors that have recommended the same thing. She's willing to do it but any other thoughts and questions I can ask the doctor for the treatment? "
vidbeau,1523850047,"Hello everyone, I am hoping you can help me, help my mamma. If this is not allowed, I apologize (please just let me know and I will promptly delete).

Almost exactly a year to the date that her mom was diagnosed with liver cancer, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy in February, a few days after I gave birth to my second daughter. Unfortunately the cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo last week. 

To try and be there for her, while juggling a newborn, and a preschooler, has been...brutal, to say the least. Basically my husband has to take paternal leave in order for me to be able to travel the 45 min so I can physically be there for my mother and family. This means he will only receive 40% of his pay. He is the breadwinner. I have a side business, but it does not guarantee income. 

We started a GoFundMe to try and cover the financial gap, so I can help out my family while my husband cares for our eldest (she is 4). Any amount is incredibly appreciated, or even if you could just share the link, as I know not everyone is in a position to financially donate.

Many/most tested positive for BRCA gene. I'm the youngest woman in the family. I'm about to enter school with a high debt and 4 years of training to do a job in surgical field highly related to use of arms+fine motor skills of hands. Its a very physical job. If I dont have the surgery now and I decide to have it after taking on debt and schooling the next time I could have the surgery would be right after graduation, when I'm 28. Have any women had trouble, after the initial healing phase of a double mastectomy, with being able to hold arms upright or use hands for intricate things for long periods of time? I have the ability to change my career now (would not be able to change later) if I have the surgery now and have problems, but this surgery is much earlier than I wanted to have it and it would all be preventative. Is this an outcome of the surgery I should be worried about? "

I went home and got a text from her sister stating, ""Did you notice we were upset today."" I told her I did notice ""A"" was very quiet and did not seem very happy to me. That's when she revealed to me that her sister ""A"" was diagnosed with breast cancer (she just beat skin cancer 3 years ago). She told me ""A"" was afraid to tell me this in person, but wanted me to know after we dropped them off that night. I was so upset and couldn't sleep that whole night and the following nights after.

This girl means the world to me, and I have been talking to her almost everyday since I was informed. She is starting Chemo this week for 5 months and then surgery to follow. She is such a beautiful girl with amazing blonde hair that she loves! She told me she is going to lose all of her hair, and it breaks my heart. I told her its just hair, and she is still a beautiful girl inside and out. I still am very upset about it, but we are thinking positive.  

I also should add, this is a girl that I was close to being in a relationship with, but I made mistakes.  A girl that I've known for about five years, but I still care so much about. Her parents love me like a son, and my mom has been in touch with her mother since we heard the news.  She doesn't have many friends, and has a small family. I want to be there for her as much as I possibly can. Can anyone please give me any advice on what and what not to do so I can make her feel better.

avocategr,1523481931,"My mom told me last night that she got a diagnosis of stage 1 breast cancer, earlier this week. From what she says, it's non-invassive and not in her lymph-nodes... two tumors under 2cm. Some of the details are a little bit vague from her- apparently the appointment where they gave her the news was imediatlely following a dentist appointment where they pulled two teeth and she had had pain medications, so she was a little fuzzy on some details. Her husband absorbed enough to say ""the prognosis is good"" but didn't write anything down. So I'm sorry for the lack of specific details. I'll know more when I go with her to her surgical consultation next week. 
Here's my big question: I'm the oldest of three. My youngest brother has down syndrome and lives with me. Our middle brother is scheduled to move across the country at the end of May. Our mom is 65 and has been in intermittently fragile health, in the past several years...I'm a single mom of three kids 9-14 yrs old. Last night my brother asked me if he should postpone his move... he and his wife have worked really hard to save for this move and it means a lot to them, so I encouraged him to follow through with it. But the more I think about it the more I worry that our mom is going to need more than I can give, alone, and that I wont be able to support her the way she's going to need.  Should I ask my brother to stay for awhile more? I don't want to fall short for our mom by falling into the old habit of being the family martyr. 
Those who have been through treatment for stage one breast cancer or who have been through it with their loved ones- how intensive is this going to be and how much help is my mom potentially going to need? 
I'm so grateful that this was caught as early as it was. i know this could be SO much worse. But it's still scary as hell, so I appreciate any advice. "

WhatACrappyDay,1523288175,"Hi Everyone

Last Friday evening I noticed a painful lump in my right breast. My first thought was that it was PMS. I was not pleased because I'm going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes. My last period was in November, and at least then the hot flashes stopped for a couple of weeks.

Saturday morning I had a red patch near my nipple that was warm to the touch and streaking and discoloration on the bottom half of my breast. I went to an urgent care clinic and was given antibiotics. It seems to be responding to the antibiotics; the red patch is gone, the discoloration and streaking is lighter, and the lump seems to be smaller.

I've read that IBC will sometimes respond briefly to antibiotics and then return. I've got an appointment with my GP on Thursday as a follow up. I need to know what to ask. I'm scared. IBC is rare, but so is Non-lactational Mastitis. I do not have an immune disease or diabetes which seem to be the common factors in Non-lactational Mastitis.

Other info: I have had a Mirena since May of 2014 (some hormones there, in case that's relevant, but I'm not on any other hormones)"
CancerSurvivorship,1523258205,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

Zeropossibility,1523240397,"2 years ago I found a lump in my breast. 
After waiting way to long I got it checked. It was benign but continued to grown and became very uncomfortable. Not just physically but mentally. I wanted it out but the doctors I went to told me to just watch it. Watch it by going to the doctor and doing test again and again. I couldn’t do that. Couldn’t afford it. No insurance. Decided to take off to CR where I saw an amazing doctor who did all the same tests as I got in the US and then did surgery the next day to take it out. Everything’s been swell since then.  About a month ago I felt it again. Around the same location. Same feeling. 
I have breast cancer in my fam. It’s a common thing. I feel stuck now. I want to go to a doctor again but I don’t have insurance.  Is there anything else I can do?"
acnaib_,1523088706,"I’m 21F and I’ve been freaking out for the past few days wondering if I should go to the doctor. I’ve always had one breast larger than the other and, on the larger breast, I noticed that I have this reddish discolouration (about the size of two-three fingers above my nipple) that comes and goes. It’s not a solid/consistent shape, it’s more like spots in one area. It seems to appear when I get out of a hot shower or when I’m cold and then completely goes away. It isn’t itchy or painful. I haven’t felt any lumps or noticed any other symptoms that I’ve read about online. I do have pain in my breasts on occasion, but I’m not sure if it’s due to my birth control pills - I know it’s a common symptom. I also sometimes get random small pimples (pea sized or smaller) on or around my breast area, which go away after a week or two. I’m not sure if I’m worried for nothing or if I should go see a doctor. I know the chances of having breast cancer at my age are very small, but I can’t help but freak out. There’s also no history of breast cancer in my family. 

Any advice or thoughts? Where do you even go to get checked for this? I’m from Canada - more specifically Montreal - and I can’t find any info online, can you just go to any random clinic?"

Fast forward almost 5 months later, she had the lumpectomy, she got to skip chemo and she’s had 7 rounds (out of 20) of radiation. She has to continue radiation regardless, but tomorrow she’ll find out if it’s gone. Her journey was very short and quick, and for that I’m incredibly thankful.

Pretty sure Wednesday-Friday morning I was having a low grade panic attack out of anxiety of this being cancer.

It started when I tried to go to bed Friday night and has been continuing off and on for the last 24 hours now. My back hurts too (lower and upper mid back) but I assumed that was due to some workouts I did this week. Pretty mild pain I would say, but I’m super aware of it now. Of course from my internet research now I’m worried I have breast cancer that’s spread to my spine which is causing the back pain and left arm numbness/tingling.

evillikeeve2,1521974432,"Hey there!

I hope everyone is doing as good as possible.

This is a bit detailed, but I needed to get it off my chest. 

I'm a 23 year old woman and I know it's statistically rare for me to get breast cancer, I'm still worried. As far as I know, my family history extends to: dad died of lung cancer last year, one great grandmother of ovarian cancer, one great grandfather of stomach cancer. There's probably other cancers in my history that I don't know about.

In January I observed that my left armpit was swollen. I didn't have a definite lump on the armpit (Google Images showed me how a swollen lymph node should look like) but it felt and looked swollen or fatter than my right armpit. I had discomfort and pain in my left armpit and breast for two weeks (granted, it could have been hormonal because since February my periods are messed up). I still have discomfort, but pain comes and goes every couple of days. It was either a pain like when you pull a muscle or a burning sensation. I also observed my left breast felt a little fuller, a little bigger and my areola skin looked all wrinkly. More on my left breast than my right breast.

I've never been to a doctor to physically examine my breasts, but I decided to get a ultrasound in February. My appointment wasn't quite what I expected. The ultrasound was alright albeit a bit rough. At one point, in my left breast, my doctor went over some sort of lump but he didn't say anything so I assumed it was breast tissue. That lump was painful and when he went over it, it felt like when you go over a bump in the road. He focused on it but said nothing.

The doctor told me both of my armpit lymph nodes are reactive but other than that I look perfectly healthy.

On my (quite short and a bit uninformative) report it says that 1) I have reactive lymph nodes in both of my armpits 2) my BIRADS is 1 3) ""No suspicious lesions for mammary neoplasia detected"" (may sound weird as I translated) and 4) Yearly ultrasounds recommended. He gave me a gel with ibuprofen for the pain and sent me off.

I looked up reactive lymph nodes and found out that they're caused by infection, chronic illness such as HIV or cancer (breast, lung or lymphoma), but if it's a common infection, the swelling of lymph nodes should go down in a month. I was shocked that the doctor sent me off, despite my reactive lymph nodes. 

I did have a long time infection, but it is obviously unrelated. A tooth on the /right/ side of my mouth was infected. I even got antibiotic treatment for it in February and it had no effect on the swollen lymph node. This was after I went to the ultrasound otherwise I would have mentioned this to the doctor.

Anyhow.. it's 24 March and my left armpit lymph node is still swollen and causing me some trouble. Breast pain comes and goes every few days and gets worse when touched, but I mostly have discomfort in my whole arm which sometimes aches or pulsates or tingles. Sometimes I feel like my left arm is weakened in compared to my right arm. 

I also have (but I have had them for a long time so I didn't make any connections at first) two visible veins on the side of my left breast.

I'm planning to do the ultrasound again at another clinic. I'm always stressing about this because I suffer from Anxiety which has focused on Health Anxiety lately. 

Someone told me lymph nodes can take longer than a month to go back to normal and that helped easy my worries a bit, but I still have no idea what caused them. No injury to the arm or anything.

I will probably go for another ultrasound in either April or May."
snakeplay,1521830660,If I am aware men cannot get breast cancer from their mothers whom have the gene. But what about their daughter? If the mother of the daughter's father had breast cancer could the daughter acquire breast cancer as well?
kylathekoala,1521660795,"According to my obgyn and a survey done through the American Cancer Society, I have about a 21% chance of getting breast cancer in my lifetime, with risk factors being that my mom got diagnosed at age 50 and I got my first period at age 11. 

Currently, I'm 35 years old, would like to have a child/ children at some point, but it just hasn't happened yet. I've been on a  birth control pill for 10 years,  I've changed a few times, but the one I was on the longest was a generic of yaz. I've had great results with the pill with regard to keeping my periods regular, reducing PMDD / interaction with diagnosed depression, and contraception. I'm a nonsmoker, healthy eater but overweight (bmi is 35), and have dense breast tissue. 

My question is this... is it worth chucking the pill to lower my cancer risk? Factors to consider: just got out of another failed long term relationship, not sure when I'd start dating again, don't need contraception right now. If I did get into another relationship (and it actually was a good one), I'd want to be moving toward trying to get pregnant... not right away, but hopefully before I turn 40. Is it better to stay on BCP or quit even though I could potentially go back? Thoughts? 

"
elusivehealth,1521561226,"I am 41, and just had my first mammogram last week. I was told that my breasts can be categorized as ""extremely dense"" (apparently only 10% of breasts fall into this classification), and how there are greatly increased risks of breast cancer in this situation because the density of the breast tissue can make detection from a normal mammogram very difficult.

I received the all-clear from my radiologist (no cancer found via the normal mammogram). I asked my primary doctor's office if they thought, due to the breast density, I should go back and get a 3D mammogram since it's supposed to be better at detection, and my nurse practitioner said it's not necessary.

But I wanted to get the opinion from you ladies as well, since some of you probably have direct experience in this regard. What do you think? Is it worth it to go back and schedule a 3D mammogram?

Thank you!!"
sinosour,1521484748,"Edit: thank you in advance for reading this and commenting. 🙏

My mom (54) felt something under her armpit right breast. Went in for mammogram couple weeks later. Doctors saw a tumor approximately 1.4 cm they said. They ordered a biopsy right away. After a week doctor called my mother and broke the horrible news to her. The tumor is hormone positive (estrogen and progesterone positive). Also the lymph node was cancerous as well. Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm... They performed a CT scan and bone scan to check if it has spreaded anywhere else. My whole family and I are all in fear, although I'm trying to keep everyone positive and worry free but it's still pretty hard on us because it's first in family... We have a meeting with doctor and oncologist this week. I want to be prepared and ask the right questions such as treatments and questions about this cancer in general. Im willing to do anything to help out my mom. I started researching all kinds of different diets... (Alkaline, low asparagine diets...) She's not overweight or anything but like I said any help I can provide for her and help her beat this!! Please help me, help her!! 

Update: 02/25/18 // The oncologist called us and said that according to the CT scan, everything looks clear (Thank God) but the bone test showed one suspecious area (left iliac pelvis). Oncologist recommended MRI just to double check on that. She also hinted that the doctor would like to start with hormone pill therapy to shrink the tumor for about 3-6 months then surgery and remove it.

Update: 03/10/18 // My mom did another MRI for both breasts. Tumor showed to be bigger. (8 cm) also MRI on the pelvis. Still can't tell if it's cancer or not. Also bone test was done check on density of bones.

Update: 03/19/18 // Oncologist called again. She said after reviewing my moms case with different doctors at the meeting this time, it was suggested to do chemotherapy instead of the pills because they're not still sure if the left iliac pelvis is cancer or not... Three different tests and they still not sure... I told her that were looking for second opinion from different hospital and doctor... Idk what to do anymore."
cath_rn13,1521441183,"Has anyone here taken Kadcyla? What were your experiences? 

My mom was recently diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer for the second time in 3 years (HER2+). In 2015 she had a left radical, radiation, and chemo consisting of doxepin, carboplatin, and herceptin. Once she was done with treatment they didn't re-scan her. I don't remember the reasoning behind this...I was in nursing school at the time and what they said didn't really make sense to me. Now, 3 years later, the same cancer has come back.  They didn't get all of it. It only spread to the lymph nodes in her chest thankfully. 

Last Thursday was her first dose of Kadcyla and she is still absolutely miserable. It hit her so hard that night. I don't remember it being like this last time. I live in a different state than they do and was only there until Thursdsy night. I had a panic attack when we were saying goodbye I did not want to leave her. Its now Monday morning and shes still wiped from it. She had a low grade fever until about Friday afternoon. But she can't eat. Diarrhea. Says she has lost about 10 lbs. Head hurts, throat hurts, chest hurts. 

I know every drug is different and every person is affected differently. I'm a surgical nurse so I don't have much experience with cancer. But its definitely one thing to battle through ilness with my patients. It's completely different with a parent. 

Sorry for the long post. Any advice/experiences shared would be greatly appreciated! "

Dyalad,1521207932,"So I've had a mastectomy on my right breast in January this year. I could not get immediate reconstruction because I am due for radiotherapy later this year and I probably would've had to get surgery again, which I didn't like.


I didn't realize how bad looking uneven made me feel like, so I decided to go shop for mastectomy bras. I had a really awful experience with a store I will not name, but needless to say, after making me go through multiple hoops, when I was ready to order a model and size, they told me that what I tried in the store were just samples and that I had to order the product online. Not only that but ordering online had shipping costs, and they would not ship to the store for me to pick up. 


Anyway, after this really bad experience, I found about this website, www.awesomebreastforms.org. They have volunteers who will crochet or knit prosthesis for you. It took me about a month or so to get mine - I just received it this week and I am so happy!


I was a bit skeptical at first because my skin is very sensitive and generally not particularly comfy for me to wear wool. Well I've been wearing it for a couple of days and I don't even feel it anymore. I'm so happy I had to share it with you gals.


Oh and they also make prosthesis for swim suits. I just ordered mine! 


Here's a pic of my [awesome breastform](https://imgur.com/FifhG8D) in case you want to know what it looks like. You can order it in skin color, with or without a nipple, the cup size you need, and you can ask for 2 if you had a double mastectomy."
gozenurhole,1521173003,"I am 24 years old. I have two children who were both breastfed for a short time ( a couple months). My son is 8 months old and about two months ago, I found a small (rice sized) rubbery/hard lump right at the base of my nipple. As soon as I felt it, my heart sank. My grandma had breast cancer. My OB saw me the next day and she looked at it. She told me not to worry about it and that it wasn’t cancer. 

About a month has passed since then and I’m having my period right now. I noticed that the lump is larger now, about the size of a pea. The lump is now slightly tender if i squeeze it. I thought maybe the lump changed due to having my period, but I called the doctor just to check. My OB wants me to see Radiology and meet with General Surgery tomorrow. I’m absolutely terrified. I know it’s not common at my age, but I also know it’s not impossible either. Please keep me in your thoughts. "

Lucas_Rivera,1520951593,"At 40 years of age, I was happily married with three kids. I was looking forward to growing older, seeing my children go their own way and enjoying my sunset years. I was preparing my retirement investments and settling into the best years of work. But I got diagnosed with cancer and the earth fell off from underneath me. Within a month I was told I had stage four cancer and if both breasts weren’t removed cancer would spread to the rest of my body. I didn’t even have time to come to terms with the devastation. I was given one week to prepare for surgery and the next morning I woke up without my breasts. I had three operations, seven months of chemotherapy, and five weeks of radiotherapy.

*“I made my way back all the way from stage four cancer and a double mastectomy.”*

I am in remission now and it took me a long while to realize that it was okay to cry and grieve for the part of me that I had lost both emotionally and physically. My body will never be the same again but it doesn’t mean that I can’t continue to live the life I lived prior to my diagnosis.

Losing your breasts takes a great deal of emotional and physical strength and courage. I have found complementary therapy really helped. As well as my standard breast cancer treatment of daily pills and monthly injections. I have also incorporated acupuncture, massage, exercise and healthy eating into my healing regiment.

*“I was fortunate to get a new lease of life and I was committed to doing everything I could to heal completely.”*

full_0f_questions,1520894546,"My mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time. She beat this once already about 8 years ago, so she’s understandably not happy about it. She's been getting checked every 6 months like clockwork, so thankfully they were able to detect this when it was still tiny.

Before she was even diagnosed, both her surgeon and her primary care doctor told her not to lose sleep over this (*not* happening). I don’t know yet what stage it is because she understandably wasn’t in a talkative mood when I called her. She said what scares her this time around is that they want to check a lymph node during the removal surgery. I figured that was standard procedure for all breast cancer patients, but I’m really out of my wheelhouse here. Is that standard procedure? Should I be doing more homework? I love my mother more than anything and the fact that she has to go through treatment again after all these years is just mortifying. I’m hoping we can put this behind us for good this time around so I’m trying to stay as positive and upbeat as possible. 

Is there any advice you guys would recommend? I want to help her during this process in any way possible, but I know she probably just wants some normalcy in her life. Thanks in advance."
ScuseMeImNewHere,1520840887,"Hi there. So I'm completely new here so I'm sorry for being rusty. I know you're not doctors, (some of you could be I don't know man) but I think I'm just looking for some form of peace of mind. So here goes. I'm a soon to be 23 year old female with decently large breasts (36GG) so my breast tissue is more than likely really dense and possibly cystic too I'm assuming. Anyway I've been having some strange symptoms lately and went to the doctor. My symptoms are as follows. Clear and sometimes yellow ish green discharge, especially when the nipple is expressed. Small itchy patch of scaly skin on areola and nipple. Severe hypersensitivity of the nipple. On top of all of that, when I went in for all of this, my doctor found a bit bigger than a grape sized lump (it doesn't move, it feels attached to the breast tissue and doesn't hurt). She did note that I do have thick breast tissue but stated this one spot stood out to her and the nurse. All of this is localized to my right breast and I have no issue with the left one. So my doctor scheduled a bilateral diagnostic mammogram and possible ultrasound for this Tuesday and a consult with a specialist/surgeon for this Thursday. I have my concerns as I have a family history of different cancers but not breast cancer to my knowledge. I'm not really worried about it being cancer (I mean I totally am. I have severe OCD so I've been obsessing over it since. I just mean I doubt that's what it is. However so many women my age go undiagnosed because of our age. I'm a skeptic and totally a hypochondriac). I'm sure it's either a cyst, fibroadenoma, or something along those lines and not cancer. However, I'm curious about something. If there's anyone out there who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, did you present any or all of these symptoms? I'm wondering just how likely all of this could be happening at once for cancer. I'm also looking for advice on the mammogram. I'm a wimp with an awful pain tolerance. Sometimes even moving my arm around my chest causes a really bad pinching pain (only noticed it with breast that is in question. Just thought of this). So any advice would be greatly appreciated. What were your symptoms? Are you doing okay now? Hope you're doing lovely. Thank you. 

Edit - also want to note I've been on birth control for almost 10 years. That's a relatively long time and I know it can slightly enhance your risk. Mix of progesterone and estrogen due to heavier cycles as a teen."

Green_boots17,1520541038,"Hello, I am new here so sorry if I am doing this wrong.

I'm looking for comfort, advice and guidance.

Back in 2013, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, shortly before her 50th birthday. She had a mastectomy and started chemo. She was given the all clear the following year.

Then, in early 2016, she was diagnosed with a different type of breast cancer. She had another mastectomy and started hormonal treatment. 

2016 was a bad year for her. She had a lot of pain in her ribs and I kept taking her to A&amp;E and they fobbed her off each time saying it is probably from coughing. She ended up with a kidney infection and was hospitalised. When she was released the doctor told her that her kidney was clear and nothing else was wrong. The rib pain persisted throughout the year and in January 2017 she had scans after complaining for so long. The results were not welcome. She now had metastatic cancer in her ribs and spine and there were unknown masses in her lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. She started more treatment (radiotherapy) and things seemed to be going okay. The masses in her organs and spine disappeared, the ribs stopped growing. Toward the end of 2017, she started getting pain in her hip but thought it felt muscular, rather than bone pain. 

Two weeks ago, the pain became a lot worse and she fell over at work because of it. She had scans as they thought she may have broken something. This was not the case. We had the results today and the cancer has spread. Now it's in her hips, the ribs has spread and it is back in her lungs. We found this out today.

She started a new injection today, which was only approved by medical boards last month in the UK. We have to wait three months for a new scan to see if it is helping. If not, then back to chemo we go.

I am at an absolute loss of what to do, how to feel or what to think.

She is my best friend. The reality that I might lose her in the near future has hit me hard and it feels like my world is crashing around me.

What can I do to make her feel more comfortable / brighten her days? What do I say? How do I cope? 

I'm sorry for the essay. I don't feel like I can talk to someone in my real life. Saying it out loud is so final. "
muffinmamamojo,1520472628,"Hi all, 34 year old female with no known family history of cancer (but only because I'm adopted and don't know any family health history). About three years ago after losing about 20lbs, I discovered a hard, immovable, pea sized lump in my LEFT breast right where my breast tissue meets the skin over my ribs. I had no healthcare at that time so I just passed it off, figuring it was probably just a cyst. Presently, it is still with me. It hasn't gained or lost any size and is still in a fixed position. 

Except I now have two obvious indentations  approximately 3 inches away from the lump in my armpit area and a moderately sized indentation on the bottom of my LEFT breast about 3 inches from the lump on the bottom/outer edge of my breast. The area in between the indentation on my breast and the lump is painful when prodded but NOT to gentle touch.

The armpit indentations are easily visible when I raise my arm straight over my head while the breast indentation is easily visible when I bend at the waist and let my breasts hang freely. At first I doubted the appearance of the breast indentation, as you can spot other  indentations that appear 'ropey' on my right breast but those obviously follow the natural creasing of my hanging breast tissue. The breast indentation is an obvious area where the tissue appears sunken while hanging (which truthfully just looks odd).

Also, I don't know if this is worth noting but I might as well, I have extremely obvious veins across my chest and breasts and an area about 1 inch by 2 inches of discolored skin above my RIGHT areola that looks like a bruise which I first noticed in August. Otherwise I have no strange lumps or indentations or pain associated with my RIGHT breast. 

Is any of this worth worrying over? I figure if my little lump was cancerous that it probably would have grown at least a little in the last 3 years but I'm no doctor. Thanks in advance."

CancerSurvivorship,1519721750,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. 

If you would like to take part, please click the following link. This will take you to the survey and study information sheet.

On my discharge paperwork, they checked the box that says, “Probably not cancer” and come back in 6 months so we can check again. Um...so I have to wait 6 months if I have it or not? And if it is, what about the possibility of it spreading?

TacocatISdelicious,1519507390,"Just found out after having core biopsy, Axillary lymph node biopsy and MRI.

I know the tumor is 3.5cm at its widest. The lymph node is negative (clean no cancer thank god) and the cancer had not spread beyond my left breast. During the biopsy some clips were placed in the mass to guide the surgeon during lumpectomy. 

The tumor is strongly estrogen and progesterone positive. It’s HER negative. Ki-67 is. 7% (meaning the tumor is slow growing).

I had genetic testing done and will have results for the most common cancer genes within 15 days. 

Right now my surgeon had told me my surgical options are lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy w/our radiation. I will also have hormonal therapy after surgery. It doesn’t seem, right now, that I will need chemo (but that may change after surgery). they will also do sentinel node biopsy to confirm there is no cancer in the lymph node (even though the suspicious axillary node biopsy came back negative). I am leaning toward lumpectomy but my decision may change depending on my genetic testing results. 

I am scheduled to have a surgical consult with my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon in two weeks. In either case of lumpectomy or mastectomy I will have the plastic surgeon there during my operation for immediate reconstruction.

This is very scary and I have not told my family yet. I am just thankful that the cancer is contained to to the left breast.

Days later we met with the oncologist and she said that doctor told her at the time of the biopsy he felt tumor was bigger than 1.4 cm. It's more like 4-5 cm...

makeupismySO,1519112945,"I was diagnosed with stage 3 IDC about a month ago. I have started chemo (DD AC-T) and I will have my last chemo session in May. My tumour is quite large, and my doctor has let me know that even if the adjuvant chemo is very effective, due to the cancer affecting the skin on my breast, a mastectomy is essentially guaranteed. 

I am fairly large chested (I wear a 36DDD) and regardless of the type of reconstruction I receive, my unaffected breast will need to be reduced. My question is: should I opt for a single mastectomy combined with reconstruction/reduction, or instead have a double mastectomy in hopes of a more symmetrical reconstruction? 

I’ve never been particularly fond of my breasts. They’re large and they swell for days before I get my period and my nipples are annoyingly sensitive. I am childfree, so I’ll never need to breastfeed anything. Given my lack of attachment (metaphorically!) to my breasts, which option is likely to give me the most symmetrical/aesthetically pleasing  results? I’ve looked for pictures of results of both approaches online, but I was hoping to get some personal experiences as well. My doctor is leaning more towards a single mastectomy combined with DIEP flap, but I’m just not sure I’ll like the results.

But today, the pet scan was clear. Today is a good day. "
got2bwjokicme,1518652238,"Recently felt a bump in my left armpit, didn't think of it much but as I googled it breast cancer became an option and I became anxious. No mental health issues but started feeling weird in my left breast and it felt tender. Got t checked ultra sound said the lump wasn't nothing but then I got my breast checked and second ultrasound said the bump got bigger when really I can barely feel it. Now my right collarbone  feels annoying and like it's swollen but this could be my mind playing tricks w me as I read it as a symptom of breast cancer. Now I can barely pass stools , and now my stools are being passed as water or very moderately. 

 Family doctor told me not to worry and dad thinks I'm worrying too much, going Friday to check it out with a second opinion.

Should I be worried? I've been having panic attacks and haven't been able to focus at school and honestly have been worrying about the worst

Also to note my right breast has a bit of pain in the corner beside my armpit, left breast feels fine now but was sore before.


Mom says it's normal and that it's because of puberty 

Should I be worried? "
GenDissaray,1518646368,"Hello,

My mom was diagnosed with stage 2 grade 3 breast cancer in the fall. She had surgery in November to remove the tumour and some lymph nodes. 

She is now starting 16 weeks of chemo before doing 10 radiation treatments. 

I want to be as supportive as I can to her. I’ve asked her how I can be most supportive and she’s said just being there and talking with her - I’d like to do more if possible. 

I call regularly and visit every few weeks (she’s about two hours away). 

I’m thinking about ordering her a meal delivery service (https://www.chefsplate.com) for a few dinners a week. 

Any other tips/ideas/suggestions for how I can be supportive?

Thanks! "
ThtevenThrowaway,1518641649,"I woke up on Thursday and found a firm lump to the right of my left nipple. I hadn't noticed it there before as I rarely check that area, so therefore I have no idea how long I've had it for or if it's normal. It is firm, movable, and feels as if it might be swelling. But I can't help but think it might be something serious. I have a mammogram and ultrasound schedule next Thursday. Any help would be appreciated."

Our child’s teacher’s wife just went into Stage IV cancer AND my father-in-law has small cell carcinoma from 55+ years of smoking. Yesterday we were told my father-in-laws options have run out and the only option left now is keeping him comfortable so he can die with family. 

With all the cancer around us we are terrified about tomorrow. 

My wife is 5’2” and 105 pounds, a runner and has been doing yoga/Pilates for 2 years. 

On 8/9/11 we lost our 26 week old daughter to a heart condition (not genetic). 

We have no history of cancer and father-in-law was due to smoking. 
I’m supporting her strongly and she’s going to the Valentines Celebation at our 3rd graders school so that should get her get distracted.  But I’m so nervous as I put on a fake “Brave” fassad. My hand are shaking and I can’t type. I’m on anxiety meds and I took a little more (OK w/doc) but it’s not helping. 

Does it matter that they booked us for 2 days out (we rescheduled for tomorrow at 9am bc we are scared)?  If it was a “GET IN HERE NOW’l would they hv told us?

Can you give me anything to chill out???

I saw these symptoms on cancer.com and she has had none of them:
Swelling of all or part of a breast (even if no distinct lump is felt)
Skin irritation or dimpling (sometimes looking like an orange peel)
Breast or nipple pain
Nipple retraction (turning inward)
Redness, scaliness, or thickening of the nipple or breast skin
Nipple discharge (other than breast milk)

mojomojomojo50,1518374200,"I know my problem is inconsequential  to most of your cancer problems. I am praying for all of you.   I am hoping you have some work arounds for me.   I have IDC (5 lesions total) and had a partial mastectomy and reconstrucrion in one breast with a breast reduction in the other breast 10 days ago, here in Texas.  I have been trying to taper off the pain meds but pain at the incisions is still intense and burning when I don't keep up with it.  I really want to stop taking the pain meds.  (I do not take pills well, even vitamins of any kind, ever. I have an awful choking reflex and choke on pills)   I've had surgery before and the worst of the pain was gone around or before day 7 , not with this surgery.  They prescribed to me:  1 or 2 Hydrocodone 5-325 TB every 4 to 6 hours and said to supplement with 2 to 4 Ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours.   It barely works on the pain but I've been taking them.  The bad news is the pathology came back, the margins are not clear and now I  have to have a full mastectomy in 5 weeks.  My doctors don't seem to understand my discomfort taking pills or the lingering pain I am having.  I need to know if something else better or easier to take is out there.  Do you have any ideas for me?  Yes, I have just forced myself to take the pills, no it hasn't gotten any easier.  Yes, its strange, but my whole family, all my siblings have the same problem with pills.  Thank you for any ideas that you have!!!!"
FreakingOutALot,1518206194,"About two or three weeks ago, my boyfriend noticed a lump beneath and to the side of his nipple. There were also pimple-like red spots on the same side as the lump. As time went by, the red spots disappeared and the lump is just behind his nipple now. But it hasn’t gone away nor reduced in size.

We went to urgent care within the first week but they assumed it was just a swollen gland. 1.5 weeks later and it’s still there, the same size.

He went to his PCP. They recommended an ultrasound. He’s scheduled to go next week. His mother is a survivor of breast cancer. He’s not overweight.

I know I am freaking out. I know he’s trying to put on a brave face. I am, too, but I’m selfishly getting upset and reading articles and freaking out. 

Does anyone have any advice about how to be supportive? Has anyone had a significant other who has gone through this and has advice? I guess I’m specifically looking for women who supporting their male SOs. Normally I wouldn’t specify but breast cancer is such a female-dominated area... Nearly all the articles are geared towards women, whereas men may have other issues related to the psychological effects of developing, or possibly developing, breast cancer. I mean, the color is pink, after all...

TL;DR: My boyfriend found a lump. I’m trying to be strong and supportive for him. Does anyone have any tips or advice about being supportive to a male partner who may have breast cancer?  Any other advice about who he should see or what he should do medically? Thanks everyone!"
unicorn_shart,1518070537,"I know this will be long so if you stick with me I appreciate it...

I know we aren’t all perfectly symmetrical but I can remember even when I was young (12 or 13 maybe) that my right breast was different. Smaller, more dense than my left. Didn’t actually pay attention to this until I was about 16. I asked my Gynecologist that I had seen for a few years at this point, to check it out. Laid back, nurse came in, GYN poked my breast lightly in a few places and 30 seconds later he was telling me it’s nothing. 

Fast forward four years. I have had pain and discomfort from the right breast on and off again. Not in sequence with my menstrual cycle, just random. Sometimes dull and achy, other times burning or stabbing. I gave birth to my oldest son. Breast feeding was a nightmare. Milk came in but right side didn’t cooperate. Eventually the milk dries up and I notice my right breast is even more dense now. 

I moved a few times, went through some struggles and ignored all things having to do with my health until 2015. At 25 I met the man of my dreams, married him and had another baby. Again, that damn right breast was painful, dense, and struggled with lactation. My nipple changed shape so it was difficult for my son to latch and nurse on that side. I made the assumption that this was just how my body was and I just had to deal with it. 

End of 2016 my son stopped nursing. The milk dried up. I lost my baby weight beginning of 2017 enough to where my boobs were basically small flaps of skin. Again, I noticed how different my breasts were. I stood in the mirror and noticed how although the fat had gone I could still see the dense lumpiness of my smaller right breast. I’m dumb so I tried to put it on the back burner. The on and off pain gets worse. So bad that I struggle to put on any type of bra or tight material around that area. I google self breast exam and notice that there is a large dense “ball” behind my nipple towards the right. I talk to a second doctor...I swear the same exam from when I was 16 happened again. “Don’t drink coffee, eat less chocolate, you’re probably just hormonal...” he brushed it off like it was nothing. 

Still concerned and in pain, I contact another local group that specializes in breast health. This female doctor made me feel like my concerns were legitimate and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound. I completed both today and got the results back with a two line note that said “we didn’t find anything. Please let us know if you have further concerns.” 

That wasn’t good enough for me. I called their office and asked for a deeper explanation. She said that because the tissue on that side is so dense that either that or a fibrocystic adenoma may be present. But again, it’s hard to tell with all that dense tissue in there...”

Currently, I am laying here still in pain and still so frustrated that my concerns have been shrugged off once again. The mass is difficult to feel when I’m laying down. It’s much easier to feel it while I am upright and pressure is applied on the top and bottom of the far right on my right breast. Could this be why they didn’t take me seriously at first or during the ultrasound? 

I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR Three doctors, one mammogram, one ultrasound, and nothing explains the mass, breast changes, or pain. 

Edit: typo fix"
NervousAddition,1518064965,"Hi everyone. I am writing this looking for advise. My wife is 35 and was diagnosed in June of 2017 with stage 4 breast cancer with metastasis in her bones, liver and lungs. She was triple positive so finished her first 7 rounds of chemotherapy and was on herceptin and perjeta.

It seemed to be working but a couple days ago she started acting very confused and disoriented. Took her to the hospital and they did a brain CT and found it had metastasized to the brain. Doctor said because there were so many they would like to do whole brain radiation. 

I am concerned because she was barely able to sign her name on the consent form and from hearing the side effects , memory issues are a major one. The doctor said this could potentially slow the growth for a few months. I am just worried that the cons outweigh the pros of this treatment and I will be stealing the last few good months she has with me and our children away.

Sorry for the wall of text. I am just lost and looking for words from people who have gone through this or had loved ones go through this treatment."
coldasballsinvt,1517982569,"Wife went for a breast ultrasound today (doctor didn't schedule a mammogram, maybe because she's under 30, not sure) because her armpit has been hurting her on-and-off for a couple of years and she finally got the nerve to get it checked out when the pain became pretty pronounced recently. Her doctor felt it and said it was definitely swollen and felt very ""full,"" and sent us to get it checked out right away because there's BC throughout the family (young too). The technician didn't tell us anything, so we're nervous while we wait for results and would really like tips. I know she's not inexperienced because she specifically comes to this hospital (rural) twice a week for ultrasounds.

- I did see a fairly large round object on the ultrasound, but it was full of a tissue material, not a black void. I know the black spots aren't always cancer anyway, but isn't a round area full of tissue generally something benign like a cyst? It looked pretty big like 1/6 of the screen, but when the tech scanned over it, she didn't really stop to hover on it. Just kept moving the wand. I asked what it was and she said ""muscles and tissues,"" and I specifically asked about the round thing and she didn't really say anything about it.

- She turned on the doppler to take pics of blood flow and to see if that would help her see anything because she seemed to be having trouble finding what the source of my wife's pain was. I saw a LOT of red and blue specks all over the screen, and when I looked it up that seems to indicate cancer? But there were no real ""clusters."" She only 
 took a few pics and most weren't even on the spot I saw. 

- After continuing to ""hmm"" and going over my wife's armpit/the side of her breast a million times, frowning and asking her to please pinpoint where it hurts, she asked if my wife has fibromyalgia, and when she said yes, goes ""ohh okay,"" wrapped it up within a couple of minutes and said we'd get results in a couple of days.

Sorry, I know this is very vague. But we're pretty anxious about it especially since when we asked if she could tell us anything, she said she couldn't, so that scared us. My wife is pregnant so we're already on edge. I'm not going to tell her if anyone thinks this sounds bad, I'm just the kind of person who feels better with knowledge so if anyone here can weigh in that would be great... thanks! :-("
Anon_ymous98,1517949129,"I previously posted about this in October 2017 which is when I found out about my mother's diagnosis.

After her second session of chemotherapy she had to have CT and MRI scans and today she found out the results. The doctor told her that cancer had spread to her bones and that she'll have to have injections for it? I don't know what this means and I still don't know if my mother is going to be okay. 

I've read that once cancer spreads to the bones it cannot be cured but it can be treated. 

The doctor also told her that following on in her chemotherapy it will target the cancer in the bones as well as the tumor. She has had five sessions of chemotherapy and her last one is this Thursday. After that she'll have more scans, her operation and radiation therapy. 

Is anyone able to help me to understand this situation better? At the minute i'm assuming the worst.

All replies appreciated. Thank you "

coldasballsinvt,1517642148,"She's 27. Her mom has a gene that increases the risk of breast cancer, and she had a mastectomy done but allegedly it wasn't considered something my wife would have to worry about. It wasn't BRCA, I know that.

My wife is a hypochondriac, and I'm a hypochondriac about *her* health because she's always sure she's dying and we wind ourselves up. So take that into consideration.

2-3 years ago, she felt like her armpit was tender and swollen. She went to the doctor (a historically dismissive doctor who has always driven us nuts, but has treated her family forever), and the doctor said she probably just had an infection and gave her some antibiotics and blew it off like she blows off my wife whenever she's anxious about something. Fast-forward a couple of years, she feels like it's bigger and it continues to bother her, feel tender, etc. A few months ago she hurt her ankle and went to the walk-in, and while she was there she told the doctor about her armpit--he felt it, then felt all her lymph nodes and said ""you just have big lymph nodes, don't worry about it.""

Well, we have a new doctor now and when she went in today for a physical and mentioned her armpit bothering her, her doctor said ""well, it's probably nothing, maybe a clogged gland or even a reaction to deodorant but it does feel fuller than the other so we'll get you an ultrasound Monday"" and now we're freaked out. She didn't feel a lump specifically, just ""fuller"" and she thought the other armpit looked a little full too. She seemed pretty serious about it, but she seems serious about everything and has scared the shit out of me a few times already, and we're admittedly not used to a doctor who actually cares.

She has also been coughing on-and-off for a couple of years so now we've wound ourselves up and think it's in her lungs. She never feels good either but she does have ""likely"" fibromyalgia. It's frustrating because whenever we mention breast cancer doctors just say ""she's too young"" and don't even bother to consider it. The hypochondria causes further dismissal.

But wouldn't she be much sicker if she had breast cancer this long?

She's pregnant so we're even more worried. Sorry for the long post!"
Lauranordersvu,1517544639,"Hello! 

This is my first post here, I apologise if I write anything in appropriate and I thank you all for taking the time to read my post.

Over the last few months my left breast has been increasing in size - whilst my right breast has stayed the same. Sometimes my left breast feels hot and itchy. I went to my GP and she could feel a lump (6oclock under my nipple), so she sent me off for an ultrasound.

Went to have my ultrasound today. I have been given copies of the photos. 
I can see several black ovals on my photos - which from my research I believe are cysts. 

What did your ultrasounds look like? Could you see the cancer? Had the tech ‘highlighted’ and measured them as such? 

I want to understand these images because the stress and waiting is so hard.

For reference - I am 28 years old, no children, not on birth control. My mother passed of bowel cancer at 38, and my Father passed from prostrate cancer at 56 (was diagnosed around 50).

battybattybattybat,1517035054,"Hello, quick intro: 30 years old, my mom died of breast cancer at 48 (pre-menopausal) and her aunt has had it twice. I have not had the genetic testing done.

I have a lump in my left breast that has been hurting on and off for a couple months. I first noticed it after randomly decided to self exam, but I had no pain there until the day after I felt it examining myself. Now it hurts every so often, some days much more than others. I can't time it with my cycle as my Nexplanon makes it very irregular.

I went to my primary doctor, she felt what I felt and with my family history, sent me for an ultrasound. $250 later, they said there was nothing concerning on the ultrasound. But the past few days it is hurting much more again and still very much a big palpable lump in my breast.

People who have had it, or who know much about breasts and the different lumps that may occur-- Do you think I should relax and trust the ultrasound results? Or should I try to have someone check it out again? It is my biggest fear to leave my daughter the way my mother had to leave my life, so it is hard for my to accept that I am fine with this nagging pain in my breast. 
Can anyone assure me I am probably fine? :-/

CancerSurvivorship,1516970513,"Hello,

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study on cancer survivorship and the emotional impact that cancer can have.   

Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a huge event in anyone’s life. Some people cope well emotionally, whilst others find it a distressing time. We believe that at such a difficult time, everyone deserves the best possible support. Our research study will compare those who are coping well with cancer, against those who are struggling. By studying the psychology of coping with cancer, we can create information and support systems to benefit everyone. To do this work, we need your help.

Anyone over 16 years of age who has been diagnosed in the last 12 months can take part. However, if you've been told that the cancer is Stage 4, palliative or terminal, then I'm afraid you can't take part. 

If you decide to take part we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every three months for a total time period of two years. The questionnaire should only take around 20-30 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. The questionnaire will include questions about your experiences and how this impacted your life. Some of the questions will ask about current mood, general coping strategies used, and quality of life. If there is a chance that this could be distressing, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous.

braidedrugs,1516832171,"on 01/14/18 i went to the walk in clinic because of a breast lump in my right breast. the doctor on call faxed my papers to the hospital within our area and within a week i had an appointment for an ultrasound which was today. before she faxed the paper off i read her notes which included ""2x2 cm"" which was the size of the lump.

i went in for my appointment at 8am this morning. got the ultrasound which included lots of images being taken from the screen. when she was done she said she had to go talk to the doctor because ""usually the arent able to go mammograms on women my age but because the lump is prominent"" she wants the doctors opinion. sure enough the doctor says i need the mammogram so they take me up to the unit and i get ready.

once i get in the room the nurse starts to ask me questions. she asks me if im on any hormones. i say no. asks if im on birth control. i say no and shes gives me a weird look. then she asks me if im sexually active and i say yes. asks me if i could be pregnant and i say no, i havent had sex since my last period ended on 01/05/18. she says she has to go talk to the doctor as well because there is a CHANCE i could be pregnant (theres not)

i sit in the waiting room in my room for 15 mins waiting for her to come back and then when she does, she tells me she wont give me the mammogram and instead i have to wait for a letter to be mailed to me, and then after i get the letter i have to book the mammogram within 10 days of my next period. 

so basically im like.. this is insane. if i have cancer youre adding 2 weeks - 2 months to my waiting time.. depending on when i get my next period and how long the letter takes to get to me.


anyway. im trying not to worry (obviously) but given how quickly they wanted to give me the mammogram (even though im well under 40 with no breast cancer in my family) it all seemed urgent. is it normal to have such a  run around and the whole possibly pregnant thing?

I have been getting bilateral sonograms every 6 months since I was 16 years old. I was tested for BRCA 1 and 2 at that age and it was negative, as it has been for all women on my maternal side. Yet, on my maternal side, my mother (47), grandmother (55), aunt (45, 50 double mastectomy), mother's cousin (50) and great-grandmother (55) have all been diagnosed though they didn't have the gene. I had my first biopsy 6 months ago, which was benign, but the lump has grown and I feel more forming, as I always have. 

As I'm getting older, I'm realising how scary this is becoming and reading stories about women who are diagnosed early and then can't have children is freaking me out. I guess I'm looking to hear from women who have been through this from a young age and what those stories are.

chester_w_143,1516728530,"Hello everyone,

Recently, my girlfriend, who's 27, found a lump in her left breast about the size of a golfball. On Friday, she is having a biopsy to test the lump to ensure it's not cancerous. She is understandably nervous about the procedure. And, of course, she's anxious about the potential results. It doesn't help that she likely won't get an answer until next Wednesday, as the hospital needs three business days to test the sample. (Thankfully my work is flexible and I can be with her as much as she likes.)

I love this woman and want to do whatever I can to help her through this, but I have never been in this position before. So I ask: How can I offer the best support possible?

Because I'm only 36 and had a family history and the CHEK2 gene (a breast and colon cancer gene) my breast specialist recommended a double mastectomy, which I had on December 6, last year. While removing the duct and bread tissue they found a 14mm tumor and tested my lymph nodes, which came back okay. I just saw an oncologist after last Friday. He told me I wouldn't need radiation, but would need to go on Tamoxifin. Does anybody have any experience with the side effects or effects in general while on the drug.
Side note: has anyone done the Oncotype testing to find out what ""level"" your tumor was? And how did that go for you?"
Gopshebzv,1515565277,"I am so sorry if I am not meant to post this here, but I have no idea who else to ask about this.

As of Christmas morning, I noticed that an area between my breast and my armpit was swollen. I hadn't noticed it before that morning and it's been there since and while it hasn't grown and I haven't noticed anything else strange, I'm still frightened. 

I read online that it could be my lymph nodes that are swollen and that lymph nodes can swell in response to an injury on the arm or hand. Strangely enough, I burned my hand on that same side the night before I found the swelling.

The swollen area isn't hard, red, or painful, and it isn't like a small lump, either.. It feels like when you have a flu or infection and your neck swells up (kinda like ""generalized swelling""? I can't think of a better term for it).

I guess I just needed some reassurance and some advice. My father was recently diagnosed with cancer and it's got me pretty spooked.

Again, I apologize for asking such a question here and I hope that all of you find peace and success in your journeys. Bless you all."
dayglo_nirvana,1515535004,"Hello.
On Dec. 23rd, I noticed a pain when my right breast brushed against the edge of my desk.  I took note, but didn't think anything of it.  Since then the pain has become constant, and any kind of pressure and the pain is just awful.  No lumps that I could tell (I try, but I've never been good at self-exams), but it's definitely gotten more firm or thicker.

I called my doctor's office on this past Friday, and never received a call back.  I called again on this past Monday and the nurse told me she was never informed of my call.  She spoke to the doctor, who said that since I already have a Gyn appointment on the 16th, bring it up to them and have them check it out.  Until then, hot compresses and Advil is their advice.

Am I overreacting, or is he not taking my concerns seriously?  I'm 44, only one member in my family had breast cancer that I know of (an aunt).  I don't think its cancer (or at least I'm convincing myself of that) but I would think my concerns wouldn't be passed off on another doctor.

Is being sent to the Gyn normal procedure?  The nurse mentioned he might have sent me for an ultrasound, but when she called back, it was just home care and my Gyn appointment.  Suggestions appreciated, and I hope you all have a pleasant day."
superman691973,1515299895,"Hello, I was really on the fence about posting here but at the same time feel it may offer or help me too. my wife (39f)had discovered a lump up near armpit last Sept 2016, we all know where this story is going. she was diagnosed stage 2B, until surgery determined the tumor was in her lymph nodes as well which put her at stage 3. Thankfully the body scans revealed no other hot spots through her body that concerned doctors. She's had a double mastectomy already, and went through the radiation process as well as 1 complete round of chemo. Currently her last session of chemo is halted due to her most recent heart scan (Muga scan?) that revealed her heart had deteriorated to 59% efficiency. She was scheduled for reconstruction in about 6-7 weeks but That's obviously on hold until her chemo regiment is completed. That's currently where we stand. 

So that's in a nutshell our story to now. I do as much as I can to help her remain happy, cheerful and feeling good about herself. I myself have never been a big 'wordy' compliment guy (things like you look beautiful, that ass is rocking.... [threw that one in for the smiles]) so if I try saying things out of character for me then she knows its only being said to boost her. she knows I feel it, but words from me aim to overdo it and come off forced. anyway this isn't about me and my issues...

now keeping her uplifted hasn't always been the easiest thing, she's carrying a lot of fear obviously but added in she's feeling a lot of guilt. guilty in part due to the financial strain this had brought us and how its affected our 4 children's lives. We had just moved to a new home in a great community for our 4 children. the wife finally had a decent - good paying job and we seemed to finally be getting ahead for once. As we know these type things cannot be planned, but we make the best of them. So added into the strain financially, this also offset vacation plans (a hopeful cruise for all 6 of us this upcoming summer before the 16ur old wants nothing to do with us anymore) we'd made and began saving for. Credit cards are now maxed and getting behind, just all around usual expected issues. We did receive some help from an organization so I'm not trying to make it all about that. We're managing the best we can, just plans are gonna be waiting longer.  

She's also upset that reconstruction won't come close to the size she was previously. she was a full DD (which being the dude in relationship I was all for), but after her 800cc limit she's looking at maybe a C cup which upsets her daily. radiation restrictions may not even let her get that much they're saying now too. she wanted to win that big lotto game this weekend to get her giant knockers overseas instead. Last area of guilt for her is that no camping trip or really anything took place for the kids this past summer. she just didn't have the strength and feels bad that we just couldn't do even that. 

anyway, as I said I was really unsure about posting here but I guess in a way i was looking for somewhere to talk to someone too. (we did run a mediocre 'gofundme' early on for financial reasons which helped a bit. just throwing that out there too avoid the question if someone asked).

So now that I've bored and spilled my issues out to you, I ask for anyone who's been through or currently fighting this awful disease... what're things you've done or are doing to keep things cheerful? while not being wordy, I also do not let her put herself down, I do always compliment or talk her outta that. I'm also trying to come up with some way to make some sort of vacation happen this year, thinking of gangbusters on eBay maybe.

Ok, I think I'm done talking to myself out loud as I cannot imagine anyone made it this far. if you did, thank you. I'd shake your hand or maybe pat you on the back for it, but just imagine I did. Again any words of advice, besides ""your an ass"" would be appreciated."
zenmushroom,1515251575,"Hello everyone. I am a 29f.

I’m going to be getting chemo soon for my stage 2 Her2+ Est+ Proj- breast cancer. Just had lumpectomy surgery. Tumor was 2.5 cm. 

I have been given an option between 2 chemo regimens:

Adriamycn Cytoxan + Taxol Herceptin Perjeta 

or

Taxotere Carboplatin Herceptin Perjeta

One doctor said Adriamycn was a terrible drug side effect wise, so I should do the TCHP routine.

Another said the AC + THP has been around longer and will have a slightly higher chance of killing the cancer and preventing relapse. And since I’m so young, I will be able to tolerate the side effects.

Halp!

I don’t know what to choose."

Any time I experience any symptom, I google and worry for days and I know Reddit cannot diagnose me. But i am confused for what I should do next. Lately, I’ve been noticing pain when pressured down on my right side of my breast, mostly near my actual side where my bra wire sits. There is slight pain on the left side of my breast as well but not as bad as my right side. I have also been seeing when I wake up that I’ve been scratching my breasts overnight with marks all over them/dry skin surrounding my nipple. It also feels somewhat hard/lumpy where that pressure is on my breast. 

Anyways, I do not have any type of health insurance and my income is fairly low. So I don’t know what I should do from here or if I’m freaking out over something not as serious. I’m only concerned since breast cancer runs in my family. "
JennaLin70,1514863405,"I noticed a fast growing lump in my breast last February and put off a doctors appointment until my employer offered me benefits and full time hours ending my 90 day probation period. That never happened because their workflow was too slow. I then applied for State of California medical plans and had missed all of the enrollment periods. I applied for special enrollment and got denied. I had to wait until November to enroll and it took until Dec. 27th before I got coverage and got to finally see a doctor. By this time I have a grapefruit size fungating tumor which indicates to me (not a doctor) very end stage cancer. The clinic doctors I saw freaked and ordered a STAT oncology referral and a STAT MRI. Medi-Cal denied both and told me I had to get a mammogram and an ultrasound first. That was scheduled for this morning. This morning they called and said they would not cover an ultrasound only a mammogram. When I got to my appointment the imaging center said they do not do mammograms without ultrasounds and cancelled my appointment. Also I don't have a boob left, just a huge open tumor which I cannot imagine squishing in a mammogram machine. 

So here are my questions (and thank you for reading this far.) 

1. Is it true in your experience that a mammogram is never done without an ultrasound?

2. Can you mammogram a straight tumor that has no flesh left on it? 

Sorry if that's gross but cancer isn't pretty. "

I remember what I went through last time. Always sick, deathly sick. In and out of the hospital. I still haven't recovered from my initial treatment (mastectomy, lymph nodes removed, chemo and radiation. I'm not in the best of health.
I have been told that without treatment I have six months to live.
With treatment I could live as long as five years.

It's just slightly goes in, almost as if an invisible ball is resting on my breast. I don't feel a lump and there are no other symptoms that I've noticed.

My 59 year old mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was caught relatively early and removed via lumpectomy. She's about 8 weeks from that and is struggling to decide if she wants to do chemo, as one of her nodes showed micromets of 2.0mm.

Oncotype DX score of 22 with a 16% recurrence rate with just localized radiation and 12% recurrence rate chemo + radiation.

She's afriad of the long-term side effects of chemo. Specifically the neurological and chemobrain stuff.

Any advice. Is it worth the 4% to get it all out of the system?"

I see you
and I know.
I know what it's like to get together for the first time
and have to set the table for one less
then you did the year before
because cancer came and
left you an empty chair

I know what it's like to feel the unraveling
of a happy family
torn apart
by grief and loss
and divorce and pain
wondering if things ""will ever be the same""

I see you
and I know.

I know that you're tired and you've had enough
of hospital rooms and bad news
and agonizing heartbreak
to last you a lifetime
I see you
trying so hard to make it a fun Christmas
and yet your tears won't dry up in time
to celebrate

Your pain is too great
for
all the white elephant parties
and gift exchanges with friends
and your night is too dark to be lit up by
mall lights
and twinkling Christmas trees

I see you
and I know.

I know what it's like to lay in bed for days
and pray for the grace
to get up
and to show up
one more day

When your soul and your body ache
from the never-ending struggle
to be seen
to be known
and yet there is no one
that sees

Your husband is too busy
and your kids don't come home
and you've lost everything
you've ever known
your health
your laughter
your freedom
your hope

I see you
and I know.

I know the depression that sets in
to your bones
this time of the year
when everyone's got someone
everybody's got places to go
and you're all alone
in a crowd of strangers
and you're supposed to be happy
but the tears won't dry up
the wound won't heal up
in time to make it
a Merry Christmas

So you stay in your frozen brick house
and watch the sun come up
and go down
every day
hoping that maybe someone
somewhere sees you this Christmas
and cares about the things you're going through

Well I do.
I see you
and I know

I know what it's like to be lonely at Christmas
to feel isolated
and unappreciated
and afraid
at the holidays

To be stuck in a place
a part of your past
you can't erase
a relationship
that no longer serves you
but still haunts and torments
you
every day

I know what it's like to live in a dream
so real and so bad that it wakes you up
each night
and crushes your chest
leaving you breathless
exhausted
and incapacitated
from the weight of its
reality

when the lights have gone out
and the people have vanished
and there is no more magic left
in your childhood stories
of Santa
or baby Jesus
or of the virgin Mary

It's all meaningless
and empty
like the bottle of pills
that lay on your dresser drawer
last night
and the unfinished plans
you had made with a friend
the day before

No matter where you are
no matter what or when or how
you come to the table
this Christmas,
I want you to know that you are seen and
loved and heard
and you are not alone.

I see you
and I know.

Errrrrrrrma,1513873663,"I found a quarter sized lump at 7o clock on my right breast early this year and in March I had an ultrasound at a Proscan Pink Ribbon Center. The doctor told me it was a fibroadenoma and I shouldn’t be worried. It was 2cm in width and less than 1cm in height, rubbery, and moves when you touch it. I was relieved and felt a lot better about it.

Now, this past month before “shark week” I had a new pain, whenever my shirt moved my nipple a certain way, it felt like it was tugging at the lump and it felt almost like a sharp pinch. It only lasted two days and went away. So I decided to finally schedule the 6 month follow up. 

Today was the follow up. I couldn’t figure out why I felt so nervous, like I knew something was coming. I was sweating in the little gown before the imaging no matter how much I tried to calm myself down. Imaging was okay, I had pain when the tech pushed the ultrasound wand (not sure what that’s called) down on the lump and around it, which I didn’t feel last time. She sends the images to the doctor and calls me in. It turns out the fibroadenoma has grown and she recommended an ultrasound guided biopsy. She stated it was not an emergency but should definitely be done in the next couple of weeks. (Merry Christmas to me)

As a 21 year old I am very nervous, I have no idea what to expect as I’ve never had a needle anywhere near my breasts. The doctor said they would use a needle and “clip” and I’m way too scared to look up what that is. I just came home, dropped on my bed, and sobbed.

I would love some personal experience stories and advice. I live with just my father and my relationship with my mother can be... strained to say the least. My mother has fibrocystic breast tissue and my paternal great aunt had breast cancer. So family-history-wise it could go either way. I also have ovarian cysts, in case anyone knows if that could be a factor. 

TL;DR Follow up ultrasound on breast lump determined it has grown and I will need a biopsy. Very afraid"
Swede2016,1513805882,"So, I’m breastfeeding and my daughter is 11 months. My family has a history of breast cancer but I don’t have the gene. A few days ago I started feeling this pain that has just got stronger and stronger and it’s on the side of my left breast kind of near the armpit. It feels swollen, hurts, and kind of hard. It feels very uncomfortable just touching the side or sleeping on it. Would breast cancer symptoms start that suddenly? Got quite paranoid....."
boxmankey,1513366321,"I am an 18 year old male in university and I scheduled an appointment for an ultrasound but missed it. My university health insurance was going to cover the ultrasound, but now that I am going home for break I won't be able to make another appointment until January, since my referral is for a hospital in my college town. I just wanted to know if my breast lump is typical for breast cancer.

I have a hard lump under my left nipple that hurts when you touch it. Also, there isn't any discharge or blood coming out of the nipple. I originally found it in the beginning of October, but didn't get it checked out until late November at my university health center. The reason being that I had a similar lump back when I was ten years old that just went away, but this time I wanted to be sure. My lump seemed to get larger in size and hurt more, and a small skin bump on my nipple grew (same color as my nipple, not very noticeable), which then caught onto my shirt at times and then stung a little when it was pulled on by the shirt. I later accidentally ripped off the skin bump, and that left a small red dot for about a day. By the end of November the bump hurt less and seemed to shrink a little (I think, not entirely sure), but now it still hurts. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Any input is greatly appreciated."

I was thinking a fluffy pillow, some soft pajamas to lounge in, I'm not sure what else to get her. Any ideas? "
Ivorykiki,1512666435,"Hi all. I am almost 23 with a long familial history of early onset breast cancer. My mom has a harmful BRCA1 gene mutation and has had a preventative double mastectomy, her mother died at age 31 of it, and her mother before her at age 33. If i have the gene, my risk is between 55-65%. To add to that, I have been taking hormonal birth control for over 5 years, which according to a recent study increases my chance by ~20-38%. I also have fibroadenomas which increase it another 6%. All together my risk could be as low as 38% or as high as 100% (though I think that’s impossible to say, so I put it at 99%).

I don’t know how to describe how I feel. I’ve been trying to prepare myself for the possibility of needing to remove my breasts for about a decade, but I still feel this odd combination of numb, fearful, a little dead (dramatic I know), sick, and depressed.

 I know that my next step is getting the genetic test done. If it is positive I plan to go through the surgery by the time I’m 26, 5 years before the youngest death in my family. If it’s negative, I’m not sure what to do since my chance is still quite high on the low end at 38% (normal 12% risk + at least 20% birth control risk + 6% fibroadenoma risk). I don’t know how to say goodbye to my breasts, I wanted to be able to have children and breast feed, I don’t want my wedding night to be marred by a lack of nipples, my nipples currently play a large part in my sexual life and I will miss that. 

This post is kinda word vomit, I don’t know how to talk about this. I am having trouble coping with this. I know that modern medicine and being proactive give me a fairly good outlook for being a survivor, but I feel this absolute certainty that I will lose my breasts. It’s depressing as fuck. Even if I’m negative for the gene mutation, 38% is still high and I don’t know what to do."
elizacat234,1512621584,"Hi,

Was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in summer of this year. Have two forms of cancer and am almost finished with first round of heavy chemo. 
Lost my hair-there’s just no way to prepare yourself for it and I opted to shave it off before I began to look like something out of the Walking Dead. Well, didn’t succeed there and call myself a mutant naked mole rat these days. 
The chemo is brutal and have had some seriously vile side effects. Almost died from perjeta, one of the original chemist administered so oncologists had to take that off my chemo cocktail. Eating and drinking are a challenge, feel weak and nauseous most of the time, and am scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy on January 24th of next year. My last big chemo session is December 21 and I need a month to recover from each session. 
Despite the odds, allergies, need to take antibiotics and steroids so the chemo side effects don’t cripple me, am feeling positive that am going to beat this strange and painful journey:)
Am not a spring chick but am not headed into a septuagenarian  paradise either. One of the best aids in fighting cancer, is how you view it. There’s no sense in being depressed or crying because it won’t help and it only hurts you and healing. 
Don’t drink or smoke and live a healthy life and still got walloped with this silent intruder. Cancer doesn’t pick people, there’s no bad or good karma related to this, it just happens. Have another year of chemo to go after surgery and not next year but the year after, I should be a-ok:)
Chemo is a nightmare, no ands ifs or buts but it’s worth the torment to be alive for longer than a couple of years, hopefully. Every day is beautiful and don’t care if it sounds contrived, it’s true, life is worth fighting for. 
"
zenmushroom,1512576185,"Hello all. I've posted here before about the worry that I might have breast cancer. Well, fastforward, I do have breast cancer. I am a 29 F with Stage 1. Grade 2. Under 2cm lump. No spread or lymph nodes. Her2 and Est positive, Proj negative. 

I recently learned that I will need to do about 4 months of chemo, surgery, radiation, and then I'll have to take Tamoxifen for 10 years. 

The thing that bums me out the most is that once the Tamoxifen starts I'll no longer be able to do Wellbutrin. For me in particular, Wellbutrin has been a lifesaver. I used to be so depressed and suicidal. I had hardly any motivation to do anything. Wellbutrin gave me energy, motivation and zapped my depression. The only side-effect is that it amped up my anxiety, OCD and anger, but since fatigue and depression are bigger issues for me than anxiety, I accepted it. I also like that Wellbutrin helps with ADHD symptoms, because while I'm not ADHD, it does help me focus on my work. 

I can deal with having to go through the temporary hassle of chemo, surgery and radiation. But the fact that I'm not going to be able to get my life back afterwards really bothers me. 

Even natural antidepressants like St. John's Wort and samE are said to have questionable interactions with Tamoxifen. 

I understand my choices are Effexor, Celexa and Lexapro. I've read that Effexor makes you sleepy and has brutal withdrawal symptoms that can last for weeks if you decide to quit, and taking Celexa and Lexapro has a rare potential of giving you heart problems in conjunction with the Tamoxifen. Also, while all three of these things may do more for my anxiety than Wellbutrin, they won't have the same stimulant effect that has helped energize me. 

Advice? Similar Experiences? 

TL:DR; Will go on Tamoxifen, won't be able to take my Wellbutrin.

&amp;nbsp;

Firstly, I think JINXING capsule must has special ingredients and complex composition. After reading the product introduction, which is a low-key and simple ingredient. 

&amp;nbsp;

JINXING capsule ingredient is ginsenoside Rh2 and starch, one capsule is 125mg, ginsenoside rh2 content is 20.25mg per capsule, content percent is 16.2% or more. It is in the line with best absorption content of ginsenoside Rh2

&amp;nbsp;

Doing a research of ginsenoside Rh2 in Chinese market, JINXING capsule is a Unilateral product only, others are compound products. Except ginsenoside Rh2, compound products contains other ingredients or other ginsenosides. Whatever of unilateral products and compound products, they have its own merits.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless of the dosage form(injections, capsules, powders and others), JINXING capsule is A single measurable ingredients, function is determined and full play the effect of ginsenoside Rh2. There is no intestinal load which caused by ingredients during absorption, thereby affecting absorption effect.

&amp;nbsp;

Ginsenoside Rh2 compound product contains other ingredient except ginsenoside Rh2, which is no rigorously verified, Absorption and utilization rate will be low, the effect of adjuvant therapy remains to be seen.

&amp;nbsp;

What is function of ginsenoside Rh2

&amp;nbsp;

JINXING capsule mysterious ingredients is ginsenoside Rh2, which efficacy is reflect by ginsenoside Rh2. What is function of ginsenoside Rh2? 

&amp;nbsp;

1.Enhance immunity
Many people know the side effect of low immunity. Ginsenoside Rh2 can enhance immunity is by enhancing immune cell activity, such as the killing activity of Lymphocytes, T cells, macrophages and others, enhance the monitoring of the immune system to prevent the invasion of harmful substances and bacteria. 

&amp;nbsp;

2.Relieve fatigue
Fatigue is due to the accumulation of human lactic acid and other metabolites, which leads to muscle tension and exercise durability decreased. At the same time, due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and stimulate the nerve center, which leads to sleepy, yawning, sluggish and other performance. Ginsenoside Rh2 has relieve fatigue function is by increasing the body's glycogen reserves, reducing the consumption of glycogen, reducing serum urea levels after exercise and inhibitting the increase in blood lactate levels after exercise. 

&amp;nbsp;

3.Anti-tumor
The reason of ginsenoside Rh2 caused by scholars attention is anti-tumor effect. Many literature and experiments have prove it. But now, there is no ginsenoside Rh2 products for medicine use.  

&amp;nbsp;

                                                    破解今幸胶囊的神秘成分

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊是何方神物，如今这么多人在吃，今幸胶囊是何种神器，能延缓衰老，缓解疲劳？让我们来破解今幸胶囊的神秘成分。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的成分 

&amp;nbsp;

起初我也一直以为，这么厉害的今幸胶囊，一定是有特别的成分，复杂的成分组成，谁曾想，看过了该产品的介绍以后，竟然是如此低调，单一的成分。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的成分是人参皂苷Rh2和淀粉，每粒胶囊125mg，其中人参皂苷Rh2含量为20.25mg，含量比例为16.2%，甚至以上，符合人体对于人参皂苷Rh2的最佳吸收含量。

&amp;nbsp;

笔者对国内市场上，网络上的诸多人参皂苷Rh2产品进行了一个小小的调查和对比，今幸胶囊是国内唯一的一款人参皂苷Rh2单方产品，其他的产品都是复方型，除了含有人参皂苷Rh2以外，还含有一个其他的成分，亦或者其他的人参皂苷成分。

&amp;nbsp;

笔者也了解了一些关于药品的相关知识，对于单方产品和复方产品有了个初步的认知。在笔者的认知看来，两者各有千秋。

&amp;nbsp;

比如说：在不考虑产品剂型的情况下（针剂，胶囊，粉剂等为剂型），人参皂苷Rh2单方产品今幸胶囊，成分单一可测，服用功效确定，并且能将单一成分，也就是将人参皂苷Rh2的功效最全面，最大限度的发挥，不存在成分间在吸收时造成的肠部负荷，进而影响吸收效果。

&amp;nbsp;

人参皂苷Rh2复方产品，含有除人参皂苷Rh2以外的成分，虽然看似更加全面，实际上却没有经过严格验证，吸收利用率也会偏低，作为日常保健可以吃一些，辅助治疗的效果还有待观察。

&amp;nbsp;

人参皂苷Rh2有何种功效 

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的神秘成分只是简单的人参皂苷Rh2，因此，它的功效就是靠人参皂苷Rh2体现的，那么人参皂苷Rh2有哪些神奇的功效呢？

&amp;nbsp;

1.提高免疫力 
人体免疫力的重要性就不需要我过多叙述了，免疫力低下，会造成什么影响，许多人可能比我了解的更全面。人参皂苷Rh2能提高免疫力，通过增强免疫细胞活性，比如淋巴细胞，T细胞，巨噬细胞等的杀伤活性，来增强免疫系统的监听功能，防止外界有害物质、细菌的入侵。

&amp;nbsp;

2.抗疲劳   
疲劳是由于人体乳酸及其他代谢产物的堆积，导致肌肉张力下降，运动耐久性降低。同时由于二氧化碳的堆积，刺激到神经中枢，引起瞌睡，打哈欠，精神不振，瞌睡等表现。而人参皂苷Rh2能增加人体的糖原储备，减少糖原的消耗，降低在运动后产生血清尿素含量，抑制运动后血乳酸含量的上升，达到缓解和减轻疲劳作用。

&amp;nbsp;

3.抗肿瘤  
人参皂苷Rh2目前受到国内外学者的重视的一大原因就是抗肿瘤功效，已经有很多关于人参皂苷Rh2抗肿瘤方面的文献和实验证实了这个结论。只是目前还没有作为药品应用的人参皂苷Rh2产品。因此，此功效暂且不提。

&amp;nbsp;

4.其他功效  
人参皂苷Rh2还具有抗菌、改善心脑血管供血不足、调节中枢神经系统、增强记忆力、延缓衰老等保健养生作用。

&amp;nbsp;

今幸胶囊的神秘成分是人参皂苷Rh2。只是这么看的话，人参皂苷Rh2确实是一个好东西，不愧是现代化的中医中药分子药物，是小分子结构，应该能发挥上述功效。同时希望服用今幸胶囊的朋友都能有好的服用效果，延年益寿。"

Hello,

I am a doctoral candidate in clinical health psychology and as part of my dissertation research I am gathering information on how individuals with chronic illness use the Internet as sources of support (gathering information, connecting with others, sharing experiences about their illness) and the effect it can have on life quality.  The survey will take 5-15 minutes to take and consists mainly of multiple choice questions with a few optional written portions.  The information collected is completely anonymous, no personal names or other identifiable information is asked for.  Data will be stored on a protected electronic server and not accessible to anyone but myself and my dissertation chair and will be used solely for the purpose of completing my dissertation.

Any help would be appreciated.

allmonjoy,1511626895,"I came to this subreddit to look for similar experiences, but even though I didn't necessarily find what I was looking for, I ended up subscribing because everyone seems so genuine and supportive. Around 2 weeks ago I noticed a really nasty bruise right under my areola. It wasn't there one day, then within 2 days it was. It is really dark with even darker spots inside, then some green and yellow areas. Honestly, it's the worst bruise that I have ever had. There was a small lump that has gotten bigger as time goes on. I went to my family doctor's nurse practitioner after the first week. She said that she wasn't overly concerned, but sent me for a mammogram and an ultrasound. I was hoping that it was just a cyst of some sort, but it is solid. I am having a biopsy on Monday and am just really anxious. I read about fatty necrosis, but haven't had an injury. Has anyone else had a similar experience or does anyone know of anything similar? Thank you so much for any input. "
infectiouslabel,1511214178,"So I'm just writing so that maybe I can get some feed back while I wait. About 3 weeks ago I found a lump on the side of my right breast. I have implants but they're new, couldn't see them leaking already. But it's so hard to control my brain. I have a mammogram and ultrasound in a week. And I go back and forth on whether I'm being a hypocondract or that this is something and I'm scared. I'm worried that maybe my implants will make it hard to diagnose, or that they are the implants and I'm making a big stink out of nothing. I'm just scared in general and all this waiting is making it difficult."
theisraelee,1511204996,"Hi everyone, 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but we have no where else to turn at this point. My boyfriend's (of 5+ years) mom had a lumpectomy about a month ago and of what I've been told, whatever they removed put her cancer at stage 1, but barely even that. She was told that if she chose to do chemo (4 sessions), her 10 year recidivism rate was 8%, so 92% chance that in the next 10 years her cancer would not return. Immunotherapy puts the recidivism rate at 10%, so her doctor strongly recommended against chemo because the difference was so small. She is about 55 yo and a doctor, but she opted for chemo and is convinced that she is going to die. We tried explaining to her that her odds of being cancer free are amazing and were all very relieved, but she sincerely believes that she will not make it. She has completely shut down, told the hospital she works in that she needs a year off (if they saw how she was handling this I don't think they'd let her return to work anyways), and sits at home crying all day. Literally. She looks up alternative medicine, feels pain, and then starts bawling and hyperventilating that she's nearing the end. For the first week or two, especially while waiting for biopsy, we were very gentle and patient with her, but when she got her prognosis we thought she'd be okay. 

I see her once a week and use my psych background to calm her down and remind her that she as a doctor knows that stress is bad for her body. It usually works but sometimes she goes into absolute hysterics, saying she'll have to sell her house and move her family back to their home country because she'll never be able to work again. Her family is getting increasingly frustrated and I've heard them yelling at her, which upsets me but they don't know what else to do. She only leaves the house to go on short walks and I'm not sure how often she showers now, so she sits wearing the same clothes every day. She's finished one session of chemo and her hair is falling out and she has another session on Wednesday and is freaking out about her hair not growing back. She will trap us for hours at a time and cry that she is so afraid that she can't make any decisions at all, and has to consult with every one of us to hear our opinion- this morning she held me for two hours debating buying a cold pack for her head. She is literally paralyzed by fear and I don't know if something is legitimately wrong or if she is just misunderstanding her diagnosis because the term ""cancer"" is so scary for her. My dad had stage four thyroid cancer when I was younger which is obviously very different, but I have experience with all of the appointments and doctors and she is ignoring everything the doctors and her family are telling her. I think she might need to see a psychiatrist but she is a very conservative immigrant from the former soviet union- she goes to group therapy by force so I don't think she'll be perceptive to a psychiatrist.

Sorry for the length, I just don't know where else to turn. Has anyone ever experienced this feeling, or dealt with a loved one who has?"
vader_is_my_daddy,1510976927,"Hi all! I'm 24F and I just had a lumpectomy to remove a  breast mass two days ago. I'll try to give my background as short as possible. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask, if it isn't please let me know. 

April 2017: found a mass and had an ultrasound. It was classified as a BIRAD 3 and I was told I would have a 6 month follow up ultrasound. 

October 2017: went to Gyno to explain that the mass was hurting constantly and possibly growing. My doctor thought it was a cyst and since I would be getting imaging done that month, she made an appointment with a breast surgeon for November 27. 

I went to my imaging appointment. They did an ultrasound and had a hard time finding my mass due to dense breast tissue. I had a mammogram done and waited to be told to leave. They came back and said they needed to do it again. Once we were done I was sent to the waiting room and sat around for what felt like an hour. The radiologist came out and asked to feel where the lump was and then asked me to put my clothes on so I could go to his office. His assistant took me back and he showed me the images. He really scared me because he told me my margins were not clearly defined and he couldn't tell what it was. It had also gone from an almond sized mass to a golf ball sized mass. He said breast cancer was low but still an option. I cried the whole way home and immediately made an appointment with another breast surgeon for November 8th. 

November: Met with my surgeon. She didn't believe it was cancer and that it could be a fibroadenoma, fibrocystic tissue, or the phyllodes tumor. The problem is that my mass was not round like a fibroadenoma, it was shaped more like fibrocystic tissue. It is a solid mass though so it couldn't be tissue and with how fast it has grown, it's indicative of the phyllodes. We decided to forgo the biopsy and just take out the mass to determine what it is so that I wouldn't be in extended amounts of pain. I just had the mass removed and I'm doing ok. 

My question is: Has anyone had any experience with phyllodes or a very oddly shape fibroadenoma? My mass had ill defined edges, inward flow, and acoustic echoing. My lymph nodes were fine and I had no signs of calcification or cysts. My doctor said it wasn't round or round with lobulated edges plus the quick growth could indicate phyllodes. I know people say to stay off the internet but everything I've been reading points to phyllodes and from what I've read, it sounds just like it. I know I shouldn't try to self diagnose but waiting is giving me anxiety.  I just wanted to know if anyone had the same experience or symptoms and it turned out to be nothing. Thank you!

onlineidisinuse,1510451153,"Hi, 

my wife was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in december 2016 (she was 33 this time last year.) She has gone through all the treatments, like: chemo, herceptin because she's Her2 positive (I think is why she is on it?) and perjeta while she was doing chemo. She had a double mastectomy done on June 8th and had a decent recovery.

In early October (2017), her right side pelvis bone area really started hurting. She describes it as if it's a bruise, and when she moves in certain twists/turns, that it feels like someone is kicking her on the bruise. When this started happening is when she was working outside a lot, but she stopped for a few days which made the pain lessen, but never really went away per her description,

There are days where it's fine, days where it's not fine. More often than not, she mentions it bothering her (she's a pretty strong fighter, so it takes a good amount of pain for her to say something like that.)

The thought in both of our minds is: Did the cancer already spread to other areas in her body? The pet scan she had earlier in 2017 showed that it was in 7 or 9 (don't remember which for sure) of her underarm lymphnodes (left breast.) The other scans and blood tests that have been performed haven't shown a tumor marker increase. There's another Pet scan coming up at the end of the month, but the anxiety is killing us.

Based on what I described, does it sound like her cancer did spread to other origins of her body? like we got it too late? I know everyone knows what I want to hear, but I wouldn't mind hearing an objective opinion favoring one side or another.. She has no other ""stage 4 symptoms"" that I've read, ""just"" this pain near her pelvic area, but the pain seems pretty bad..

thank you for any insight"
Desert_grape,1510374995,"I am 33 years old. My plastic surgeon sent some tissue he removed during a breast augmentation to a pathologist, I have ADH. Exact wording from pathologist is:


Flat epithelial atypical and focal minimal atypical ductal hyperplasia/ 
Columnar cell changes/
Fibrocysric changes/
No lesions or masses are identified


My mom had breast cancer 8 years ago at the age of 62 (survived!).  Cancer was estrogen positive. 


I’m currently waiting for a referral to a breast surgeon. Aside from checking for lumps regularly and yearly mammograms, is there anything else I can do? I have Kaiser for insurance, they were a huge pain in the ass to deal with when I had melanoma and I had to fight them just to get the initial biopsy. I’m scared they won’t be aggressive enough. I’d like to have further testing done and have a double mastectomy if that’s an option. I’d like to be tested for the BRCA gene, if insurance refuses I’ll gladly pay out of pocket. 


Any other tests I should request? Has anyone had ADH turn into cancer?

I live across the country and cannot leave work at this time to go and be with her. I just don't know how to be supportive during this time and was wondering if anyone had any ideas.

LuLuCheng,1509676943,"To keep this brief, it's a 17 y/o male, around 270lbs, and 6'2. Ever since I was young (earliest I remember is around 6th grade, when I first noticed the lumps) I've had these solid lumps under my nipples. Recently though the lump on my right side has gotten a little larger and more ball like while also being painful to the touch (while the one on the left nipple is flat and barely noticeable). They are directly under the nipple as far as i can tell and i've haven't seen nor felt any form of discharge either. 

I know that Reddit can't diagnose anything, but my family can't afford health insurance (Father makes too much to apply for Medicaid as far as I'm aware, and other health insurance providers cost too much, unfortunately, so I'm caught between a rock and a hard place) and I don't want to put the burden of debt onto my family by freaking out and raking up a doctor bill. 

Anything would be appreciated."
Ihavealumpagain,1509661145,"So I went to have an ultrasound and mammogram early September because I had a huge lump in my right breast. Luckily it was just a cyst, they didn't even perform the mammogram after the ultrasound revealed it was a cyst. 

So in the buildup to that appointment I was very concerned and expressed my anxieties to my family and friends. Everyone one told me to calm down that it's ridiculously unlikely that at my age, 27, I would have breast cancer. 

Well now I have some new developments. Since my ultrasound in September the moles on my breasts have roughly doubled. I had maybe 5 small ones on each. Now I have about 10 but the newest ones are very small, almost like someone dotted me with a brown pen. 

The other new development is a painless lump in my right underarm. It's worrying me, because usually I'd have an ingrown hair in the other underarm and it was always very painful. I started exfoliating in both underarms and no longer have to deal with painful ingrown hairs. Now the new painless lump coupled with the moles has me worried. 

I was just wondering if it merits attention or if I should just calm down, since I was just given the all clear in September.

TL;DR:  New painless lump in my right underarm, but ultrasound in September showed nothing but a cyst in my R breast. Also new moles on both breasts. "

Decidedly-Undecided,1509212218,"I'm almost 28, female. I've had a rash on my areola for almost a year. I have eczema, so I'm used to weird skin things. I used my cortisone cream and it didn't help. After several months I was at an urgent care for my asthma. I had them look at it. The doctor told me it wasn't concerning except that it wouldn't go away. She gave me an anti-fungal cream, antibiotics, and steroids. The steroids were for the asthma, but she said it might help. 

It still hadn't gone away a few months later. Thursday I was at urgent care again go my asthma. I brought up the rash to this doctor. She told me not to be alarmed, because it's rare, but breast cancer can present without a lump and just a rash. I told her that my family has a history of cancer, so I was pretty concerned. I guess since my grandpa had pancreatic cancer, and they are the same family of cancers, it increases my chances of breast cancer. 

I googled the hell out of it. The rash matches almost exactly with Pagets. Of course it a highly aggressive and invasive cancer. I have an appointment on Tuesday to see my pcp. I've told my mom and my best friend, but no one else. I'm trying to not freak out. I guess Pagets is really very rare. I feel like I need to talk to someone, but I don't want to burden my best friend, and my mom is a little preoccupied because my grandma is back in the hospital for the third time in as many weeks. 

Waiting for any information until Tuesday seems impossible. Even then, it's just my pcp and he will probably have to refer me elsewhere for answers. I'm a bit terrified. I have an 11 year old daughter, and I don't want her to know unless I'm sure it's cancer, but keeping how upset I am a secret has been hard. Today I blamed migraines...

For the past 2-3 months I've had random subtle pain around my chest/ribs/breasts on both sides but mainly the right side that lasts for a few minutes at most. The pain on the ribs occurs mainly if I apply a little pressure with my fingers. Some day it could be on my breast, some day on the rib, etc. I felt a 'lump' to the right of my right nipple but I'm not sure if its actually a lump or a lymph node cause its theres a string of lumps/nodes all the way to my armpit. I'm not sure if its normal for one to be able to feel their own lymph nodes but I am pretty skinny. 
I also have swollen lymph nodes under my jaw because I need to get a root canal in the near future. I'm not sure if this could somehow affect the nodes near my right arm or if the infection in my tooth is causing the pain. 

Do I have breast cancer or does this seem like something else to you guys?

ghostlywriter89,1508805597,"Hello,

The other day I discovered a mysterious blue/pink mark (or bruise?) the size of a pencil eraser. After reading about IBC, I am extremely concerned and it has been on my mind for days. I made an appointment, and after speaking to a nurse she said she has never heard of anything like that leading to cancer.
What could it be though? I do not recall getting injured there, my bra is not uncomfortable, etc.

Has this ever happened to you?

Thanks for reading."

stapletit,1508155801,"I'm going to cut straight to the chase here and say that I do not feel as though my mum is in safe hands whilst she goes through her treatment. 

Her partner, 51 years of age and standing 6 foot 2 inches is a threat to the family - violently. 

He has no independence, he relies on her to do everything for him after a 'long day at work' (8:00 AM - 5:00 PM). 

Now, the problem. When she is bed-ridden from her chemotherapy she will not be able to make his dinner, clean the house, make him drinks, walk the dog, prepare his lunch for work, show him affection. These of which are many things that cause him to become angry and aggressive, if not done for him. 

She will need to be taken care of. I will be around, but there is only so much that I can do. However, in this scenario I will be expected to do everything for him and for her as he is simply, incapable. 

He wont make her food - he can't. He wont keep the house clean - he doesn't know how to. She will become intertwined in conflict when he's had a 'bad day at work' (He is passive aggressive). 

My mother, the women who I look up to will be in very poor hands, in terms of care, and its all because of the man she is with, he's incapable and she knows this. 

I'm stuck in the middle because he's aggressive towards me, he's physically violent towards me whenever I help because he can't control his jealousy and doesn't get the 'thank you' or 'reward'. 

All I want to do is help, without him physically hurting myself or verbally abusing my mother, brother or myself. I am just in search of some advise/support during this time. 

Thank you to those who chose to read this and many more to the people who respond.

Erase_me_mommy,1507763375,"Hello, I am 36, from NB, Canada and I was diagnosed oct 06, 2017 with infilitrating ductal carcinoma intermediate grade with metastaic carcinoma on the lymph nodes. Er&amp;pr neg. Her2/neu +

I turn 36 aug 09. Aug 10 I started having pain shooting from my armpit to my left nipple. It felt like a blocked duct. I thought it was a pinched nerve or a reaction to a progesterone only bc I had tried and then stopped using after it messed up my cycle.  I felt nothing at the time and went about my weekend. I had a breast exam done in may because I had seen a spot that looked different on the underside of the breast that was now hurting and was told I have typical breast cysts seen in women my age. 

About a week or so later I started to feel a pea sized lump. At the end of august I went back to my doctor as the lump had grown and the pain was still there. She couldn't feel it doing a regular breast exam. I had to show her how to find it by basically squeezing my breast and pushing down. As soon as she felt it her face changed. She ordered a mammogram and ultrasound and on sept 09 I went for these tests. 

I knew going into her office in august it was cancer, I just knew. The day of the mammogram I seen the last image the tech had taken of me still on the screen and I seen this large white glowing spot. It reminded me of a dandy lion that had went to seed and was being blown away by the wind. I have spent a lot of time reading and looking at medical related things in my life. I am currently studying to be a med. Lab asst. And I knew exactly what I was looking at. I knew it wasn't a simple cyst. Cysts are smooth, round and even typically. This had uneven edges and was spread out. It looked like it had tendrels branching out. I spent the next 45 minutes watching this invader on the ultrasound screen.  

I was called days later and told I was being sent for a core needle biopsy under ultrasound and would be seen at the breast health clinic. I had the consultation with the BHC. And by this point I could see an indent on the underside of my breast where the spot I had been concerned about in may use to be. 

I went for the biopsy. They start with the ultrasound then the doctor came in and said we are biopsying the breast but also the armpit. My heart sank. At this point I knew it was cancer even though no one would say it and was hoping it wasn't in my lymph nodes. 

Oct 05 I went for an mri and oct 06 was told I had cancer. So the staging process starts tomorrow with a ct scan. A bone scan on tuesday and a muga test friday. This friday I meet my oncologist. I was told I will under go chemo, surgery and radiation. 

So far I have been pretty stable emotionally. I had been prepping for this since august. So the diagnosis wasn't a shock.  I cried because I was right and was hoping beyond hope that I was wrong. I even knew why type it was based on my research. 

I am very much a lets get this started so we can all move on with lives kinda gal. I dont want to be coddled by my health care workers but I do want to know exactly what is going to happen and what my options are. I dont care about my hair or even losing a breast or both. I want to live and raise my boys into men. 

What I am looking for though are connections to others in my area who can help me navigate this system. I want to also speak with someone about cannabis oil/medical marijuana. The breast health nurse stated asked me why i would even be thinking about that today. She said that yes i will lose my hair but other than mild nausea i won't have any other issues such as pain. But this goes against everything I have read and would rather treat the chemo effects as ""naturally"" as possible. 

Anyways thats me and my current situation. "
Bigbadmomma,1507601423,"Have a vertical dent in left breast from nipple all the way down, the right of that indent looks a little lumpy. I've taken a few days to process and get my head on straight, and plan on calling GP tomorrow. 

I do have a mutated BRCA 1. My grandma died of breast cancer when I was 5, and there have been multiple close relatives with ovarian and pancreatic cancer, so I'm pretty vigilant about breast exams. 

I'm 39 and I've had 2 mammograms in the past just for screening, both showing dense tissue and significant calcification. 

My question is, from what I'm reading most dimpling is just that, more dimple like. I'm not reading a lot about vertical lines. It looks more like a true crease as if the bottom part of my breast had been folded. 

It can be difficult for me to feel deeply into breast tissue simply because of breast size (DDD), but I can't feel a lump. "

emnems94,1506565059,"Hi everyone! I was hoping to get advice on what's been going on lately with the symptoms I have been experiencing. Hoping to ease my anxiety. First things first, I am a fairly healthy 23 year old woman. For the past two weeks I have been experiencing itchiness around both breasts. I thought it may be due to dry skin but it has not subsided. There are currently no visible changes to my breasts and I don't feel any lumps, which helps me to feel better. However, I just recently started experiencing upper back pain. This pain originates at the middle of my back and radiates to my shoulders. I unfortunately googled my symptoms and first thing that popped up was breast cancer, which caused me to go into immediate panic. I should also mention I do have anxiety and am under stress  so it may play a role in all of this. Although, was just hoping to get some advice from those of you on here. Any advice is appreciated!

Hello everyone, I've had these spots covering my breasts for as long as I remember. There isn't any pain and they don't feel any different from the rest of my skin, so I never paid them much attention. I have read that spots like these could be a symptom of breast cancer or just a minor skin condition.

If anyone has some insight as to what these spots are, I would very much appreciate it. I know the best advice is to go see a doctor, but I'm unable to do so in the short term. Also I apologize if this is the wrong sub to post in, and if so I'd like to be pointed in the right direction. 

Thanks!

madpeach90,1505717408,"For the past 2 plus months, my nipples have been itching most of the time. It started with one nipple and 1 month later the other one caught it.
 
symptoms experienced-

itching
swollen or erect nipples
flaking 
minor weeping during first month

Have never been pregnant or breastfed, not pregnant for sure. Been to a GP with some concerns and was prescribed rather potent steroid cum antibiotic cream. symptoms eased after 7 days of use bit came back 3 days after stopping the cream.
I have a background of eczema and family history of breast cancer (mum diagnosed in her late 50s).

1 plus month into this issue, went back to GP and had an ultrasound, found no lumps or masses.

Nipples have always been really huge and dark for a fair person like myself (which mum pointed out was strange considering I have not breastfed or been pregnant before). since experiencing this problem, it just got worse. I understand nipples come in different shapes n colour and all but wondering if this is within normal boundaries. The GP didn't want to comment. After normal ultrasound, she just suggested visitng a dermatologist. 

Currently still experiencing nipple ""hardness"" and itching, some flaking few times a week. I am wondering  if I should go to a breast specialist or insist on a biopsy etc. 

Sorry for the long post, any opinions are appreciated! "

soprettyvacant,1505053799,"Hi all. My mom has been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in under a year. She had a lumpectomy the first time and will be undergoing a mastectomy with reconstruction this time around. Of course it's 100% her decision what to do with her body but I'm worried sick and wish she wasn't doing the reconstruction just because of the extra trauma of more surgery (though I understand it). I've been through my own cancer journey (colon) and know everyone has to make the decisions best for them. 

SO, seeing that my cancer surgery was pretty different than what my mom will be facing I was wondering if you all could recommend any helpful things you had/bought after surgery that made recovery easier. Just ingenious little tips that you wouldn't have thought of until you unfortunately had to live through it. Thank you all so much. Sending my love!!!"

CEFan4Ever19,1504816495,"My poor mom had to be hospitalized on Monday after receiving chemo a week ago because she had a fever, a bad yeast infection, and low white blood cell count. I was alarmed when my dad called me and told me this. I live far away from her and I'm 15 weeks pregnant , so this sucks.

Anyway, she's angry that she can't come home yet. Because of her yeast infection, she has to stay for the reminder of the week. She called me up crying and severely upset last night. I told her she needed to calm down because it will cause her to not heal as quickly as she needs to. She got angry at me and hung up on me. When I apologized, she yelled at me and told me I lack empathy. 

I called her this morning to tell her about the baby because I had a prenatal appointment today. She was very short with me, snapped at me for not being able to understand her on the phone, and told me she's lost patience with everyome but my dad. It hurt. I have been asking whether or not I should come down, but both her and my father told me not to. 

I feel like an inadequate daughter and that she hates me. My dad called me last night to tell me that I didn't do anything wrong, and not to take her personally. It's hard to do being pregnant.

Microem,1504113359,"Sorry for the long post! 

My mum has been diagnosed with ""type 2"" breast cancer, and had biopsies on 2 lumps in her breast, the first was cancerous but they said the second has ""precancerous""  cells. They were originally planning on doing a lumpectomy, but upon finding out the second growth has these precancerous cells, they have asked her to consider a mastectomy. 

She's been overall very positive during the whole process, up until being asked to make this decision. She is worried that the cancer may be more likely to come back with just a lumpectomy, but obviously is also worried about how traumatic a mastectomy could be. She has been asked to make her decision before she come back to see her consultant next week, where they will have the results of her lymph node biopsy. (If the lymph nodes come back positive for cancerous cells, we think she will have to have a mastectomy regardless).  

The 3 options she has been given are:

 - 2 lumpectomies and liposuction from somewhere else to fill the holes created. 
- a mastectomy but leave the nipple and breast skin 
- a full mastectomy removing all breast material and nipple. 

Her questions are, is it more likely for her cancer to come back if she only has lumpectomies? What are the chances of cancer coming back if she decides to have a mastectomy but keep her nipple? And is there a difference in recovery time between the 2 types of mastectomies? 

Any experience or advice you may have would be much appreciated. "

My sister has a growing lump in her armpit and has had an ultra sound and mammogram a year ago and doctors told her it was no worry, but she's been putting off getting a second opinion because she's anxious. 
That's all the history I know, no confirmed breast cancer.

I've been experiencing serious breast pain for the past month, my breasts are very swollen so my bras don't fit any more, and my tissues are dense. I had a breast exam and I scheduled an ultrasound for Friday, and the doctor told me I will be let known if there are cancerous cells, since it's not a cyst. 

My concern is that tonight, my left breast in particular has been in more pain.l than usual. Feels bruised, and I am getting sharp pains. I took a look and my nipple is much darker than normal and there's no bump due to my areola being swollen, there's a ring around my areola and a swollen portion under my nipple which is white.

I'm trying not to worry, but I need some assurance. Does this sound like something that could just be normal? I have a poor diet and had my IUD taken out two weeks ago after it gave me a lot of issues (all the symptoms of pregnancy without being pregnant). Was inserted December 2015.

Carlylynn,1499753779,"Hi all,
I am 23 F, and I had a benign fibroadenoma removed 3 years ago in March 2014. They had said to follow up within the next 2-3 years, so I made an appointment with my doctor. After surgery, they had said they were not able to take all of the ""bad"" cells out so some are probably lingering. They had also said I had a hormone imbalance. I tried so hard to search for the copy of the surgery summary but I've got no luck after my house had been moved around.

Lately my pains have been getting gradually worse and I'm not sure what to do. I made an appointment for a sonogram (they say I'm too young for a mammogram) for August, but honestly the pains are so bad I want to cry. i get pains once every hour every day now. They mostly include:

-overall soreness
-pain under the nipple and on the left side
(sometimes shooting pain, sometimes it feels like the insides of my breast are tightening)
-burning sensations around the entire left side (where I had it removed) the longest it had last was half hour and not even grabbing it made it better
-It feels like hard tissue way underneath the nipple if i press down, but if i press down too hard then it's too painful for me.

My family has a history of cancer in general and I'm scared this could be something serious though I'm not sure what. When my Dr examined my breast she was concerned too and didn't know what to tell me.

I'm honestly at a loss for words and I'm not sure if I could get an earlier appointment, but I'll call again tomorrow.

Has anyone experienced this with any benign tumors? I'm scared :(

Thank you.

TLDR; benign tumor removed 3 years ago, now getting intense burning/pain sensations that are getting worse. Can't get appt. sooner than August, second opinions?

She said that we'll try different things and that she could take me to the doctor if it doesn't go away.

I noticed a bit of clear discharge and a small 1-2 cm lump on the top of my nipple. I get sudden jolt of pain that go straight there as well. My doctor wants me to have a mammogram but, the office I'd go to refuses to do it due to being 27. I've been pushed back to an ultrasound until the end of the month. I'm scared because they pulled a precancerous colon from me a few months back. I feel like I'm being treated differently because of my insurance as well. Unsure what to do but trying to distract. I've got two little ones who need me here. Anyone have a similar story? "
CEFan4Ever19,1497196546,"About two weeks ago, my mom found a lump in armpit, so she went to the doctor. The doctor looked concerned and scheduled her for a mammogram. So she has that done and they said that they found a mass in her breast and two enlarged lymph nodes. The next morning, they called her and told her that she had to have chemo, even before she had her biopsy. Tomorrow is when we get the biopsy result,  and I'm freaking out.  I don't want her to have cancer. I'm so scared.  Thanks for listening. "

cooperpooperpoops,1496164849,Hi everyone. I'm new to this. I'm 31 y/o. I have DCIS. I'm currently waiting for my genetic testing to come back. I'm so unsure of what to do if I end up having the BRCA gene. People are advocating for mastectomy if I do have it. I don't have kids but we were trying until I got diagnosed a month ago. I'm trying to figure out if breast feeding is reason enough to not do a bilateral mastectomy. Or if I should just get the one done? Or just get my lumpectomy and radiation and keep an eye on it? I would like to ask others who were/are in this situation what they've done. Thanks so much!!

forestjock,1493788721,"Hello lovely people!

A really lovely co-worker of mine got diagnosed with Breast cancer at the end of last year. My position is seasonal, so last week is the first time I've seen her since her diagnosis and she mentioned that she is starting another round of chemo this week.

I don't know her very well, but she is just the sweetest lady and I would love to give her a small gift to make her upcoming treatment a teeny tiny bit less crappy. I don't really know her tastes, so I'm kind of looking for something that is nice and useful for every Chemo patient (although I acknowledge that everyone has different experiences with it!!). I know soft toques/headscarves are  popular gifts but i'm going to avoid those as I have no idea whether she already owns some or even uses them (this is not her first round though, she has already lost her hair.)

With such a tight turn around I also don't have time to order online so ideally it would be something relatively generic that I could find at a drugstore or mall.

I will of course attach a nice card reminding her how awesome she is :)

Thanks in advance!! Big hugs to those fighting right now - you are amazing.

angelacarterny,1489765176,"According to several studies and surveys, women are more likely to develop breast cancers all across the world. In fact, it is a hidden diseases and starts at any point of time. Most women unable to detect the signs and symptoms of cancer because of their breast density; in fact, according to some studies, dense breast may cause the risk of cancer in women. In a layman language, breast cancer can strike at any age and starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. 
These cells altogether form a tumour that can be easily identified through breast MRI or mammogram. These can be seen on an x-ray machine. The collection of these cells is quite fatal because they grow at rapid fire rate invading surrounding cells/tissues. They infect other tissues and become more dangerous overtime. 
Breast cancer occurs mostly in women; however, it must be noted that cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancerous and can infect other cells. To be more precise, breast cancer often begins in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple. 
In fact, some originates in the lobes. There are also other types of cancer that are less known to people. Some people report a lump in the breast, which is also a sign of breast cancer. 
That is why it is important to understand the basics and symptoms of breast cancer to curb the conditions. You should also contact and report to a health care provider in order to prevent the cancerous cells to further grows. In fact, it is also important to understand about the benign breast tumors or abnormal growth of certain cells because of most of the cells are not life threatening. 
However, certain cells can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Doctors can easily detect benign or dangerous cells that might influence your future cancer risk. In fact, according to certain studies:
•	Women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x-rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. 
•	Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. 
•	Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening.
Doctors also recommend breast MRI. MRI of breasts is a detailed and comprehensive study that requires the administration of a gadolinium-containing contrast agent during the study. In generic terms, MRI is a type of imaging test that uses magnets and radio waves to check for abnormalities in breast. It allows doctors to see the soft tissues and even abnormalities in breasts. So, don’t just wait, schedule an appointment, if you suspect anything wrong.

the problem i have is that my mom is a total internet noob, so im trying to figure out what tools would best fit her goal. And her goal is to have a conversation with people dealing with cancer, to help them if she can. She wrote a book few years back, detailing her physical and emotional struggle after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, and is working on another book. From what i can see it really helps her psychologically to write. And quite a lot of people call her every month, just to have a chat, ask her advice, so on.


obvious way to have her connected to the net is facebook, but i just wanted to see if anyone had any other idea?


i was thinking of suggesting to her to do a series of youtube videos where she reads her own book (as shes giving it away for free anyway). Maybe do a few videos talking about her life story (shes into meditation, alternative healing, she went through a 42 day water fasting, reads a lot of psychology, philosophy, so on."
FluffyPurpleThing,1487445635,"I'm starting chemo in a few weeks. I moved to this area a few months ago, so don't know that many people and am not very close (geographically) to my family members. I don't have a job (which is actually good in this case because I can take the time to take care of myself) but I'm wondering if I can manage to go through chemo on my own. 

My questions: 

1. What were your side effects and how long did they last? 
2. Were you able to lead a more-or-less normal life while going through chemo? 
3. Did you need another person with you at all time while you were going through chemo, or would have several visits of friends/family been enough? 
4. How did you deal with the hair loss? I'm not sure if I'm freaked out about that part or not... 
5. I could ask one of my brothers to come stay with me for a couple of weeks, but since he lives on the other side of the world, it will just be for those two weeks. Should I ask him? If yes - When would be be thes best time for him to be with me?

DrAmishDalal,1487408744,"Breast cancer, among women, is steadily on the rise since the last 10 years. It is the most common cancer among women, far ahead of cervical cancer. Unlike other cancers that usually affect women after the age of 50, breast cancer can be diagnosed among younger women as well. 
A sharp pain in the breasts, accompanied with some tenderness, often becomes a cause for concern, especially if it is a prolonged experience. Though a lump or mass in the breast is associated with breast cancer in a vast majority of women in their early 20s to 50s, it is usually a benign tumour in a majority of cases. Besides, breast lumps may also be the cause of hormonal changes among young adolescent women. 
A tumour can be either benign or malignant. A benign tumour is usually not malignant tumour, which indicates at cancer. Unlike malignant cancer, it does not invade surrounding tissues or other parts of the body. Benign tumour usually does not require further treatment unless they affect nerves or blood vessels. When tests indicate at malignancy Amish Dalal, an accomplished Surgical Oncologist, may recommend a surgery, if required.  
BENIGN BREAST TUMOUR
Types of benign breast tumours
The major types of benign tumour can be classified as:
•	Fibroepithelial breast tumours
The unusual masses are a combination of various glandular elements and stroma (tissues).
•	Cysts and abscesses
Cysts are sacs containing fluid that may develop as result of hormonal changes associated with menstruation. An abscess is infection that may occur in women who are breastfeeding. 
•	Calcification
When calcium salts get accumulated in a breast tissue, referred to as calcification in medical terms, may indicate at a potential breast cancer.  While most calcifications are caused due to normal biological processes, certain microcalcifications may be a result of breast carcinoma – a condition that develops from epithelial tissues of the breast. 
•	Other types of breast lesions
Some breast lumps or masses may develop after a surgery, as a result of natural biological changes like pregnancy, among other reasons.


Symptoms indicating the presence of a benign breast tumour
Common symptoms of non-cancerous tumour or ‘fibroadenoma’ are:
•	Infection in breasts
•	Damaged tissue or fat necrosis, which appears like a cancerous lump but cannot be distinguished unless a biopsy is conducted 
•	Fibrocystic breast disease
When tests indicate at malignancy, the medical oncologist usually recommends a Surgical Oncologist. Dr. Amish Dalal examines the medical condition of the patient and determines the line of treatment. 
MALIGNANT BREAST CANCER
Types of Malignant Breast Cancer
Breast cancer can be broadly categorised into two types:            
Invasive breast cancer
When nearby tissues are invaded by cancerous cells that break out from the inner surfaces of the ducts or lobules, it is referred to as ‘invasive breast cancer’. These abnormal cells may travel through the lymphatic system or bloodstream, spread to the surrounding lymph nodes and gradually to other organs like lungs, liver or bones in the early or advanced stages of the disease.
Non-invasive breast cancer
Here, the cancerous cell does not break out but remains restricted in its place of origin. When the cell originates in lobules, it is known as ‘lobular carcinoma in situ’ in medical terms, while it is referred to as ‘ductal carcinoma in situ’ when it remains inside milk ducts. The phase ‘in situ’ means ‘in its original place’. This type of breast cancer can eventually spread to the surrounding tissues and organs, developing into invasive breast cancer. This explains why it is also referred to as ‘pre-cancerous’.
Dr. Amish decides on the stage of malignancy and starts on the immediate course of treatment. 
Symptoms of Malignant Breast Cancer
Here are some of the symptoms that may indicate malignant Breast Cancer:
Changes in how the breast or nipple feels
•	Tenderness or a lump or an unusual mass in the underarm area or near the breast or underarm area
•	Enlargement of pores in the skin of the breast (often resembling that of an orange peel) or a similar transformation in the texture of the skin
Changes in the appearance of breast or nipple
•	A sudden unexplained alternation in the shape or size of the breast
•	Sudden swelling of the breast
•	Dimpling or puckering on the breast
•	Nipple which is turned slightly inverted or inward
•	Unexplained shrinking of the breast, which usually is only on one side
•	Breasts suddenly become asymmetry in size
•	Skin of the breast or nipple turns red, scaly or swollen
•	Appearance of rashes on or around the nipple
Discharge from the nipple
For women who are not lactating, a whitish discharge from the nipple may be a symptom of malignant cancer.
As lumps in the breast is the major symptom for both benign and malignant cancers, awareness in women regarding the initial symptoms, followed by health check-ups and medical tests immediately is mandatory. Early detection of malignant tumours usually enhances the chances of cure. A monthly self-examination is a first step towards detecting an unexpected lump in the breast and consulting a doctor immediately. When tests indicate malignancy, the patient usually needs to approach a radiologist for chemotherapy and, if necessary, a Surgical Oncologist for further treatment. Doctor Amish Dalal recommends the surgery that may be well-suited for individual patients after a thorough examination of the patient’s medical tests.

I'm 42(f). ~6 wks ago I noticed my left breast was itchy in one spot like a mosquito bite. The itchiness persisted. Yesterday, I noticed I had a small rash and the itchy area was red and thickened. Today, I noticed my affected breast feels heavy, swollen, and hot. I noticed today my affected breast is bulging out the side of my bra and my husband told me my affected breast looks swollen toward my midline. 

Today, I went to urgent care. The doctor diagnosed a rash, prescribed  a steroid cream, ordered a mammogram and ultrasound for tomorrow, told me to contact my obgyn tomorrow first thing and book an appt ASAP; and, keep an eye on the rash. If my rash is fungal, she said, the steroid cream will make it spread, if it clears, it's dermatitis, if nothing changes, let's see but get my exams and appts done. 

The cream is helping the itch but my boob still feels hot, and I'm anxious.

We’ve been through a lot. Remember when we went shopping for our first bra? Good times. During my teen years, with my personality and your good looks, we worked together to attract some top notch honeys. We bagged some real winners, like Brent, Jack, Squid, and ultimately we got our hooks into the best guy ever so we married him. Sometimes I think he likes you more than I do. But your time to shine was really when I had my babies. What’s this, you are going to provide us with free baby food for as long as we need it? All the while causing belly flattening contractions to my abdominal muscles… You really killed it in the postpartum era. Thank you for that. But then in my forties you tried to kill me.
