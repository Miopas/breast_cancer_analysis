kelly2300,1586825957,"Hello Everyone, 

In June of 2019 I found I had HER2+ Stage 3 breast cancer-three tumors in the breast and cancer on at least one of the lymph nodes under my arm. I chose to only do immunotherapy (targeted) along with a complete diet overall, supplements, Reiki, acupuncture, Chinese Medicine,  &amp; spiritual and emotional healing. In December of 2019, I was found to be tumor free. I have done a few more immunotherapy treatments since then, but have stopped. I will have my scans again in late May. 

I've always known that my journey was never meant for me alone. I am in the process of chronicling my journey through the blog, Beyond Pink America: [www.beyondpinkamerica.com](https://www.beyondpinkamerica.com)  I write a lot about the power of food, listening to your own voice, God, and the body's innate ability to heal. While this is my story, it is my hope that it brings light to others too. 

Best, Kelly"
colomization,1578973729,"And I think my friends/relatives may be sick of my endless questions (they think i’ll be fine) and I feel the need to ask everything in one go

Birads 3 lump around 1.9 centimeters. Found it last November and had to hold off medical tests because of obligations at work. Biopsy has removed the lump and doctor told me to return Monday for the result. 

Questions: 
- is it true that biopsy spreads cancer cells? (Aka am i fucked here on) 
- doctor said she also found blood vessels deep in the lump, is that a bad sign?
- does thermal imaging work better? (I’ve been seeing this group on facebook with a guy admin advising against biopsy, mammograms and chemo and im just so confused right now) 
- lump is sometimes painful. Sometimes it isn’t is it a sign? 
- And if it is cancer, how much is treatment in the philippines? Where can I get all the necessary financial aid? 

I just want to be prepared for all of this. I believe that I’m too you g for cancer and preparing for all the necessary stuff I feel is the way to go. :(Thank u!"
HonorableMention111,1591572025,"Hi all,
I posted a few weeks ago about being recently diagnosed. Really appreciate everyone’s thoughts and responses. 

Last week, I had my port put in on Tuesday and started AC on Wednesday. Overall, it went pretty well. Felt a little under the weather on Thursday, Neulasta Thursday night, and then Friday probably felt my worst, mostly just a blah feeling and sad. Was back to my normal self on Saturday afternoon though, and have overall felt okay since. Except of how foggy and maybe a little dizzy I am. I’m a total space cadet and just feel a little loopy. Is this chemo brain? Or possibly just side effects from AC, side effects meds (Claritin, zofran, omeprazole)? I know I can message my doctor for verification, but thought I’d check here to get other’s firsthand experience. 
Thanks!"

Some of the information is free to download and keep, others you have to 'check out' by getting an account ( for borrowed books I recommend transferring that file to another device so it's not deleted). If you are a  musician, you-tuber, pod-caster or writer yourself you can make an account and post it on that site so that  it will be accessible for future generations.   


When you're tired of digging for BC info, there's also lots of movies on there, fiction and non fiction, etc. Just enter name of movie or authors name. in the search line. 

You'll see 2 search bars on the home page... scroll down for regular searches. That top bar is for the 'Wayback Machine'.

If it's been saved  you'll see it, just click on a date and a link will open that shows the times available, click on that and you're good.

WesternSkyGirl,1533823452,"Hi. I will try to keep this brief! I'm a 46 years old female in pretty good health. I recently had my yearly exam with my gynecologist / and a mammogram. I have dense breast tissue and have had to go back several years ago for a recheck which was clear. Not this time. I was called back in two days. Instead of just a sonogram, they ordered a sonogram AND an additional mammogram. My gynocologist called me the NEXT day, himself, telling me the reading was ""low chance of malignancy"" I had a feeling this was going to happen (I felt it in my gut) and I always feel like it's more serious when call backs happen so quickly and it's the actual doctor that calls. What I didn't expect was him referring me to a general surgeon, who then called the next day (which was yesterday). I now have an appointment for a ""consultation"" with the surgeon in a week and a half and he may or may not do the biopsy that day. Maybe that's common, but it didn't feel common. I've been through adenocarcinoma in situ (basically stage 0 cervical cancer) and had a hysterectomy so naturally, I'm a little concerned. OK, I'd be concerned anyway. Is this the normal path? I remember how sick to my stomach I was during my cervical cancer rodeo, and I'm sure every hospital / state / doctor has different methods of this course but what should I expect? Is it routine to have a consultation first, or is this a scenario of, I'm going to the surgeon for him to tell me I do have breast cancer and we are going to sit down and discuss options. I'm trying to be positive, I also want to be prepared. (side note, I have had some unexplainable dull lower back pain for several months, I don't know if that is worth a mention or not) Thanks in advance."

kwd0288,1564145863,"My Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer over three years ago. She was diagnosed with Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. She had a double mastectomy with reconstruction &amp; chemo. A year ago she coughed up blood and went to the doctor. Turns out, she had pneumonia. They took CT scans of her lungs and saw one small nodule and said it was probably scar tissue but would do scans again in a year. Monday of this week she had her follow up CT scans and they found 15+ nodules on her lungs ranging in size from 5-9mm. It’s been the hardest, most emotional week for my family and me. This morning my Mom is having a lung biopsy and next Thursday she is having a PET scan. Her pulmonologist said that the nodules present themselves more like cancer, but that’s just an assumption based upon the scans. Her breast cancer hasn’t always been clear to me as it relates to being triple negative... initially we were told her cancer was not triple negative but the cancer cells present/act as if it’s triple negative. So confusing. 

Anyways, have you known of other women with this kind of ‘scare’? Having scans show something in other areas? I’m just wanting to understand what others have been through or know from experience."

I just completed my 3rd round of chemo and I had my pet scan on Monday. I have to wait until Friday to find out the results and plan the next stage of treatment with my oncologist. I always wear my lucky underwear to get my pet scan results and so far it hasn’t proved me wrong. Upon diagnosis my breast cancer had moved onto several other locations but since chemo started every place has become smaller and/or less cancerous. I understand I may not get good news, but I’m truly hoping for some. I don’t have any questions but maybe people could send some good wishes my way.

worrywart234,1588438881,So I’m probably the biggest worrier you could ever meet. I am only 21. Not history of breast cancer in my family. I have had this place on my nipple for years that is like a cyst. It almost like a pimple. Lastnight I felt underneath the skin on that same breast something kinda like a knot. I’m not sure how to explain it. My boobs have been sore recently because I’m about to start my period so I’m wondering if the discomfort I felt could’ve come from that or what. Somebody I know said it could be a gland swelled up from the cyst on my nipple. I also heard it could be fibrocystic. I just need answered because I am freaking out and I don’t want to be freaking out until I can get into the doctor.
makeupismySO,1519112945,"I was diagnosed with stage 3 IDC about a month ago. I have started chemo (DD AC-T) and I will have my last chemo session in May. My tumour is quite large, and my doctor has let me know that even if the adjuvant chemo is very effective, due to the cancer affecting the skin on my breast, a mastectomy is essentially guaranteed. 

I am fairly large chested (I wear a 36DDD) and regardless of the type of reconstruction I receive, my unaffected breast will need to be reduced. My question is: should I opt for a single mastectomy combined with reconstruction/reduction, or instead have a double mastectomy in hopes of a more symmetrical reconstruction? 

I’ve never been particularly fond of my breasts. They’re large and they swell for days before I get my period and my nipples are annoyingly sensitive. I am childfree, so I’ll never need to breastfeed anything. Given my lack of attachment (metaphorically!) to my breasts, which option is likely to give me the most symmetrical/aesthetically pleasing  results? I’ve looked for pictures of results of both approaches online, but I was hoping to get some personal experiences as well. My doctor is leaning more towards a single mastectomy combined with DIEP flap, but I’m just not sure I’ll like the results. 

Has anyone else faced this choice?"
sputnik_zaddy,1543993733,"Need the lowdown on being helpful to wife. She has been diagnosed with HER2 positive invasive carcinoma.  Nothing seen in the lymph nodes.  CT scans today to confirm stage 1 breast cancer.  Still waiting for results.  
 We're very pleased with the surgeon and all of the assigned staff at the local, nationally recognized cancer center. My wife is due to start chemo, followed by a mastectomy, followed by a radiation treatment.  
She's now on leave from work.  She's also getting set up with a specialized psychiatrist and support group offered by the cancer center.  Starting to attend an art class there as well.  
She'll be getting her first short hair cut on Friday, in anticipation of chemo.
In the meantime, she's going to be home to meet our 5 year old daughter at the bus stop after kindergarten.  We have wonderful neighbors with kids who my daughter is friends with, to help on the days when my wife will not feel good.  We have friends locally, offering all kinds of help, and friends and family who'd come at a drop of a hat, if needed.
What I need help with relates to me being pretty inept at being particularly sensitive.  I am a hammer when a tuning fork is needed.  I write code for work and self-affirmation.  The way I deal with hurdles, like the one my wife is facing, is stereotypically different and not particularly healthy.  That's where I need help the most - how do I put my own bullshit aside and be helpful? 
My wife is a very strong, wonderful woman who happens to suffer from depression and anxiety.

personificate,1574740897,"Hey everyone, advice needed

I took my mother to a surgeon today who said her lump was too large for a standard lumpectomy and she could have a masectomy or go on chemo for a few months then have the lumpectomy. It has grown a lot since the summer, when she was first aware of a lump.

She is uninsured. To complicate things, she just lost her job last month. She earns 34k a year. More than the Medicaid allowance even with breast cancer option (200% of federal poverty). To complicate things further, she has not filed her tax returns for 8 years after her divorce. She told me she didn't know how to do them and just didn't do them. This disqualifies her from [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) open enrollment right now, the subsidy portion. The cheapest plan she can get is $725 and doesn't cover anything. She only has enough personal savings to get her through December, without any medical costs. She cannot afford $700+ plans in any capacity after her rent, food, and car insurance etc. 

I am here asking if anyone knows of any program or anything that can help her financial situation so she can get care ASAP. 

Most groups will not see her without some form of upfront payment or insurance.

The surgeon today is going to do a new biopsy tomorrow which is cash $400. Lab tests are billed later. 

Any suggestions, programs, help, advice, is more than appreciated.  Thank you."

I only had stage one cancer, and now because of the treatment I’m in a lot of pain and disabled.  Before radiation, the oncologist and radiologist said I’d be back to normal in 3 weeks. Now they say I’ll never work again. I’m only 45.  
The doctors say the amount of radiation was correct, but everyone reacts differently.  Long lasting pain after is a possible side effect of radiation, but I was never told.

That same breast (above) the nipple has a large almost flat like oval mass in it (I would say walnut size). It is nothing symmetrical to the other side.

It hurt badly and I went to hospital twice being told it was fibrosistic breast changes. 
Since then I’ve went to my obgyn 
She thinks it’s fibroendonomas, was sent out for biopsy by this point it was 20cm in size and had tripped over the past few weeks. 
My ob ordered and ultrasound 
The ultrasound confirmed it was tumor and not a cyst on the ultrasound it was jagged edges and my lymp nodes were swollen 
She’s now ordering a biopsy, she told me it wasn’t an infection but now it’s either an infection or cancer and I spoke to many medical professionals that say it does not look infected including her.

I'm 30 and I know I get brushed off easily, but I still have the lumps. Is next step biopsy?

They couldn't confirm that they are cysts or just fibrous."
lady_lupine5,1591496111,"Hi everyone. Recently I’ve had a swollen lymph node on my right armpit (about 10 days, no signs of illness or infection) and my right nipple is puffy and warm. I got particularly worried today because it felt like I lost sensation on my right nipple. I was wondering how I would go about requesting testing for this? Or what tests to requests. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you"
Tobikens,1594218137,"I’m so very anxious. I noticed a dent in my boob a couple of months ago and attributed it to weight loss, but thought it was worth mentioning to my doctor when I saw her in June. She immediately sent a referral for an ultrasound on my breast. I am 21, my family has no history of breast cancer, so the chances are low that there will be anything there. Regardless, my boob is different and I’m so anxious and scared I feel like I could throw up. I can’t get my heart rate down. I’m doing my old panic attack tricks that I haven’t had to use in a while and to some extent they’re helping. My appointment is in an hour and a half. Wish me luck."
mca360,1589753082,"Hi there-

Throwaway account here for obvious reasons. I've cross posted this on the ask doctors subreddit and am looking for feedback. I've been in touch with a doctor already and will call my PCP tomorrow.  

White male, 28, very healthy and exercise regularly, slightly high intake in alcohol but not wildly out of line with recommended amounts per week. I am very on top of my health and get regular blood work and quickly investigate anything that seems out of the ordinary.

\-------

About four days ago, I noticed that the area near my nipple felt a bit sensitive/tender. I am very much aware that men can get breast cancer, and being a bit of a hypochondriac, I felt around my whole breast area thoroughly. Despite a bit of tenderness, there was no lump or any thickening of the tissue in that area at all. I woke up the next day and there was redness only in that region - above my left nipple, slightly on the ride side. The area was still sensitive, still no lump.

The day after that, I woke up, the redness was pretty much gone (a tiny localized bit still exists but it had definitely decreased from the day before). However, I definitely noticed a thickening of the tissue above my nipple at this point.

Today, there is still a touch of redness, but only right over the area where the skin felt to be tightening a bit. There is now a pea-sized lump in that area, and it has remained sore and tender.

So right now, there is tenderness or soreness in the area , a pea sized lump that is very easy to feel, and a bit of redness but only right above where the lump is. There is a touch of swelling too, but nothing significant. Otherwise no apparent symptoms such as fever or itchiness.

I did a telemedicine visit this morning for peace of mind, and the doctor suggested it was infection from possibly a bug bite, abscess, or ingrown hair. I don't see any indication of that superficially, and redness has also definitely decreased. The doctor told me to wait until tomorrow and if its not much better, then begin a course of antibacterial antibiotics such as Bactrim. He also suggested I do heat compresses on the area which I have been doing.

I am worried however that this is something a bit more sinister, such as male breast cancer, and am playing out tons of worrying scenarios in my head. I realize that male breast cancer is rare, and to get it at my age would be almost an anomaly, but I've done my research and there are few (very few, actually) cases of men my age having it. But I certainly have a few of the symptoms- lump (albeit a painful one), redness, and some swelling.

What I am trying to justify, if it is indeed a cancerous ailment, is how quickly this all started. And that it was immediately painful, which seems abnormal to breast cancer based on research I've done. No family members, male or female, have had breast cancer except for one great grandmother who is long-deceased from other causes.

Anyway, I would love to hear suggestions, as this is stumping me quite a bit, and is very worrying. I am going to call my PCP tomorrow morning, first thing. I believe she is also only doing tele-medicine at the moment, though, so I'm not sure how helpful that will be for something like this. I will discuss with her either way.

Thank you in advance for reading and for any advice, opinions, or feedback."

Kootenaygirl86,1596441955,"So where do I begin , I noticed some changes in my breast and felt a small lump inside my left breast , I went for a mammogram  05/07/19 and they said I have B scattered fibrograndular tissue , bi-rads 2 benign , no discrete mass significant architectural distortion or suspicious microcalcifications demonstrated.  They recommended I go for a yearly mammogram and I am due for one again soon here which is good because my left breast seems to have grown a bit more and is still sore on and off and the lump to me feels bigger in size... and one thing that is freaking me out is the fact that when I squeeze my breast this clearish type discharge comes out and I have had a hysterectomy so I am not pregnant .. it is only coming out of one breast and I do have a video that I could post and some photos if anyone is willing to maybe help me out ? I just don’t want to go to the doctor for something I shouldn’t even worry about ... thank you 🙏🏻"
throwawayaccount8268,1539729188,"I'm a 19 y/o female with no family history of cancer that I know of. I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask before I get checked out. Here's why I'm worried: my right breast has been feeling a bit weird as of lately. 
  
It's been swollen and a  little bit painful for the past week. First I brushed it off as hormones (I have nexplanon). My boob started out a little lumpy, but then began to feel a bit more firm than usual. Not really having anything else wrong with me, just thought it's strange and concerning. Nothing is wrong with my left breast.

My questions:
What does breast cancer usually feel like?
Are there other side effects of breast cancer that can often be overlooked?
Did you have an experience similar to mine? 
Do you think this is breast cancer or a cyst or just hormones?
Any advice?

Also, sorry if I sound like I'm overreacting.. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and everything worries me.."

gailwestwood712,1588645414,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January.   I’m a 57f with no family history of bc. ERPR+ 98% and 97%, HER2 negative.  Although it was stage 1a,it was grade 3 fast growing.  I started on insulin about 2 years ago for my diabetes. I am told that fast growing cancer takes about this much time to grow into a 1 cm size which was the size of mine.   I read a study that showed a link between basal insulin and breast cancer in some women.  Any other women out there that are type 1 LADA diabetic that have been diagnosed with bc?"
tetrapterodactyl,1600896524,"Met with my plastic surgeon the other day for my reconstructive surgery consult, and he told me to stop smoking weed because it has twice as many carcinogens as tobacco (but edibles and others are ok). Was shocked to hear that because I thought cancer patients used marijuana for pain and my quick Google search didn't find anything conclusive on the smoking effects, but I'm thinking he's just being extremely conservative?

Have any of you guys been told that?"

1killertit,1591068267,"I'm 34 years old and just finishing up primary treatment (chemo, surgery, radiation, Kadcyla) for triple positive breast cancer. For the past couple months, my oncologist and I have been trying to find a hormone blocker that's going to work for me. Zoladex is out because it causes me extreme GI pain, to the point where I can barely move, and with Lupron I got to experience the joy of a week and a half of feeling like I could barely draw breath, followed by severe mood swings, paranoia, uncontrollable rage, and an appetite that's so suppressed I've lost ten pounds in the last three weeks. I can't be on either of these drugs for the next 5-7 years, which is what my oncologist is recommending, if that's how it's going to be. I'm also concerned about an elevated risk of reproductive cancers, as my grandmother had uterine cancer after menopause, so I'm considering getting everything taken out as I'm not having biological children anyway. 

What I'm most concerned about is whether the psychiatric side effects are going to be the same as the Lupron. I know that when the TCHP shut my reproductive system down back in September, I did not have any mental side effects at that time. My mood has been very stable and positive up until the goddamn Lupron shot. So, has anyone here had to go the oophorectomy/tamoxifen route, especially this long before natural menopause? What was it like for you?"
divinearcanum,1553520906,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January 2016 when I was 29. I had my first dose of chemo on my 30th birthday. I powered through it all and am now on hormonal treatment even though I am cancer-free. I feel like what people don't understand is that, even though I look normal now, I still have nerve damage in my fingers and my body is now twice as old as it should be. Everything came to a head yesterday where I was trying to get dressed for my sister-in-law's birthday party and I just broke down with uncontrollable bawling. I have difficulty wearing button-ups because buttons are hard with the nerve damage. I spent $300 on all new clothes just late last season and now none of them fit. My upper body is fit and unchanging due to my fake breasts but I can't wrap my head around all the weight and mass that has been added to my thighs, hips, stomach. I can't wear most jeans because my skin is super sensitive thanks to chemo. I can't find ones that fit a tall/curvy woman. I am lamenting that I have to get rid of all these clothes and figure out how to dress a body of a woman that is much older than me. I lament to my doctors all the time. I'm doing everything: exercise, watching my diet, etc etc. and nothing helps.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still depressed from yesterday and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like anyone really understands me and I was hoping I could find someone here who has some advice or can just share these feelings with me. I hate this right now. I hate that I feel this way and that I hate myself. I don't know what to do. I'm so uncomfortable all the time. I feel disgusting with my scars and I feel like I can't say how I feel because I either have to be strong for my family or I feel like my friends don't want to hear me complain about this while they are in the next stages of adult life.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Depressed and need advice on how to clothe new body.

Thanks for reading xx"

jukieb123,1556891813,"Hello. I had four AC treatments, during which I lost all of my hair (except for my eyebrows :) which was to be expected. I am now 3 of 12 Taxol treatments in. I have been told by the nurse that my hair will begin to grow back on Taxol. I even asked for clarification on that on a recent visit because of what I’ve read on the Internet about losing hair on  Taxol. They again assured me that it will begin growing back. My hair doesn’t seem to be coming back at all. Has anyone had experience with this? That is, hair beginning to come back even during Taxol treatment?"
Tubbygoose,1595437401,"I made a post a couple of days ago about getting a biopsy done.  My results came back this morning and I have invasive ductal carcinoma.  Obviously it’s not what I hoped for, but I am not surprised either.  I saw the tumor on the sonogram... it looked like the Boogie man from Nightmare Before Christmas.  I pretty much knew then and there.

So anyway, I am waiting for a call back from the oncologist.  What can I expect going forward?  At this point, I don’t know what stage or if hormones are involved."
