I immediately stood up and felt the area and found what seems to be a round mass that is sensitive to the touch. I went to the doctor and after insisting it be checked, got her to schedule a mammogram. I have hardly been able to sleep since I found it and am super nervous about my mammogram appointment tomorrow. The lymph node under the left side of jaw feels super swollen. I know I should just wait for the doctor, but I'm freaking out a bit. Are there any other symptoms with breast cancer in men? I don't have any discharge or anything. Thanks in advance."

doeatmypoop,1550656632,"Hi, I wanted to ask if anyone here had these symptoms before they found out they had breast cancer? 

My mom has been fighting breast cancer for a long time and I am a bit worried because I feel weird on my left breast. 

That breast has felt weird for about two years, I always had sharp pain that came and went out nowhere. But since December that the pain has been getting worse. Now I feel a burning sensation on it all the time and when the sharp pain comes it‚Äôs a lot stronger than it was before.
The burning sensation has also moved on the upper, left side of my back (right behind my breast). And since a few days a red mark appeared on the breast...

I have tried to find all kinds of excuses for this for a long time, because I am afraid of cancer. I have seen how it has destroyed my mothers life... 

But I finally decided to go a doctor and I had waited for a month for that appointment and when I told her about what was going on, she didn‚Äôt even see my breast. She didn‚Äôt even touch me. Nothing. She stood up like a meter away from me and looked at me as if I was crazy :( and then the only thing she said was that I needed to go to a gynecologist for that problem...

But here in my city is impossible to find an appointment in a gynecologist. They don‚Äôt want to take any new patients and I have insisted and called all of them, but they don‚Äôt want to take me or tell me to call again in a couple of months, haha. And the appointments then (if they even want to be give me one) are months away... 

I am sorry to complain, I just want to know if I am just overthinking this, has anyone also had the burning sensation/sharp pain/marks on the skin of the breast?... "

creambanded,1579226366,"Hey--I'm about to have a breast ultrasound later and I just kind of wanna have reassurance? 

So around last week of September last year I began to feel a pain on around under my left breast? I got it checked on October and everytime the doctor--or I would press the part it hurts but there's no huge lump there or anything, more like a jelly type? It's not hard but more of a soft lump? 

I failed to get it check for follow up ultrasound last year since I got busy and I just had the free time for it. Now I'm nervous as hell and getting paranoid huhu. 

So randomly at times I would feel it--I can't feel any hard lumps, like nothing's even there! It's just everytime I press a bit hard on a certain part I can feel the pain. I can't see anything closely similar on google so I don't really have an idea what this is! I thought it was gone a couple of days back but I guess it's still here. 

Any idea what this may be?"

Koalio15733,1594757064,"TL:DR I have a large lumpy growth and I'm getting it biopsied tomorrow. I could use some advice and support as I don't really have family to go to.

Hi everyone! I feel the need to share my story so far. I am 42 going on 43 this year so I hadn't had a mammogram yet. If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it. 2 months ago I saw that I had a bruise on my left breast that came out of nowhere. I know I hadn't bumped it or had one of my critters jump on it. I am notorious for having random bruises though and didn't think too much of it at the time. I checked it again after almost a week and the bruise hadn't changed in any way. That's when I started feeling around on it. Directly below it was a hard lump. I told my husband (he's a nurse) the next day when he got home. We both felt it and knew it needed checking.

Due to Covid and crippling social anxiety it took me two months to get an appointment with my GP to get a referral for a mammogram. That was 2 weeks ago. During that exam by her she found a second small lump in my right breast. During the 2 month time period between finding the lump and seeing my doctor, I started to have increasing soreness and pain in my left chest/breast and down my arm. I do have angina, but this was different. The place that the pain was in was more my chest wall than interior in my chest. My GP scheduled me for a mammogram and sonogram ASAP, and referred me to a breast specialist/oncologist.

That was done last week. The right lump is small with diffuse edges and the radiologist said it's a 50% chance that it is a growth of some kind. The left lump is very large, very dense, and has sharp edges in a cauliflower like pattern. The ultrsonographers and the radiologists faces were grim when looking at it. He said he gives me an almost 100% chance that it is a tumor. They said I needed a biopsy ASAP. I already had a follow up appointment scheduled with the specialist for tomorrow. Since my appointment last week I have been called by all 3 places about getting the biopsy done as soon as possible. So I see the specialist tomorrow and have the biopsy scheduled at her surgery center for right afterwards.

I'm not going to lie, I am scared. I am almost positive that it is going to be malignant. I have relatives on both sides of my family that had breast cancer. I know that my mom's Aunt died from it. My mother had uterine cancer when she was about my age. She also had at least one benign breast tumor. 

I don't really have much family support. Both my mother and both husband's parents have passed. My dad remarried only 4 months after my mother passed. He has since alienated me for various reasons. One of which being that he continues to hold parties for all of my stepmother's family during covid. So I'm honestly scared to be around him because I can't afford to get it. I already almost died from bronchitis once when I went into septic shock. I am also disabled due to multiple car accidents effing up my back pretty badly. So I'm not able to do much or go out much. 

The one great shining light is my husband. He is the best support anyone could ask for. He is very stoic and doesn't show fear or hurt very much. He is ex military so fear is a weakness, lol! He also works 60 hours a week just to support us, so I don't have as much time with him as I would like. I know that he is scared out of his mind too. We are only going on our 10 year anniversary being together this year. Without him, I don't know how I would be right now. 
 
I apologize for the length of this. I just needed a place to tell the story and hopefully get some ideas of how to go about navigating this. Thank you for reading this."

lost-vulpecula,1602382408,"Hello again, everyone, finally starting to feel better after cycle two of  TCHP chemo and now I've got questions regarding some things.

First, what does it mean when people say chemotherapy side effects are cumulative? Are things going to get worse with each one? Or is it on a case-by-case kind of thing?

Second, I've suddenly developed indigestion, which I've never in my life experienced and makes it impossible to eat normally - is this a side effect of the chemos or something I should be looking into elsewhere (will be asking about it regardless, but curious all the same)

Third, this chemo mouth...what can I do about it? Everything is slimy, tastes metallic, or feels like licking a battery! Does it go away farther from the infusion or does it just stay eventually?

Fourth, are aggressive mood swings normal? No one mentioned anything about any kind of emotional affects, so I'm not sure what can be expected and what is out of the ordinary!

And finally, what can I do about my skin? The hair is already a loss, and to some degree I've accepted that, but my skin is freaking out. It's behaving like I've had a sunburn or something, I'm really not sure how to explain it other than dry, peeling, and angry.

calliemhart,1595023765,"Certain inherited gene mutations can put you at an increased risk of developing one or more cancers in the future, but knowing you have these mutations can help personalize your preventative care, and help you manage your future cancer risks. Out of the following 11 gene mutations, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most researched, and have been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, which put women at increased risk of having multiple breast cancers, as well as ovarian cancer in a lifetime. However, having one of these mutations doesn't guarantee you will develop cancer.

For those who have already been diagnosed with one or more cancers, multi-gene panel genetic testing may be a useful resource for you to understand your risk of future cancers, diagnose possible hereditary cancer syndromes (ex: HBOC and Lynch syndrome), learn of opportunities for targeted therapies, and discover inherent risks to children.

So far we have seen the surgical oncologist the most (he did the biopsy, ordered MRI ect). We have just met the medical oncologist who chose the chemo plan. 

It‚Äôs so much easier to just trust the doctor that was given to us but would you say it‚Äôs worth it to get the second opinion? The doctors we have now aren‚Äôt in a cancer center with a team approach. Or will treatment be similar regardless?

boolehealth,1550648496," Hello, we are a team of data scientists with family members that battled cancer. We have decided to compile illustrative stories based on public sources to craft stories of people battling cancer. We would love to hear the community's feedback.

[https://medium.com/@booleai/sarahs-story-battling-breast-cancer-d1bf1a39bf86](https://medium.com/@booleai/sarahs-story-battling-breast-cancer-d1bf1a39bf86)

In **July 2015**, when Sarah had just turned **42**, she felt a lump in her right breast. She thought it was just benign, similar to lumps that her mother and aunt developed around her age. However, when she consulted her doctor, she was advised to get tested. Both her **mammogram and ultrasounds** came out to be normal. Sarah still felt that there was something wrong with her. However, it eventually proved to be quite a difficult task to convince her doctor to conduct a **biopsy**.

After convincing her doctor to do the test, Sarah was diagnosed with bony metastasis and visceral metastasis to lung and liver, and she was already at **Stage 4**.

At first, Sarah had to undergo a **bilateral mastectomy**, which was later accompanied with all sorts of complications including an MRSA infection. Sarah had 4 cycles of ***Taxotere*** and ***Cytoxan***.

Sarah suffered from skin rashes and high fever, after her chemotherapy. Since her liver enzymes were at an elevated level, her chemotherapy got delayed. Moreover, her **alk phos** was **801** and **ALT/AST** was **5‚Äì6 times** normal.

Unfortunately, cancer did not respond to chemotherapy and it failed to shrink or regress. Then Sarah was started on **hormone therapy** with ***Letrozole***, but it resulted in her cholesterol levels increasing dramatically (e.g., **LDL 220** and then **290**).

In **August 2017**, the radiologist identified enlarging intrathoracic lymph nodes. Her doctor recommended **bronchoscopy**with biopsy of a lymph node, and the pathology report came back as **metastatic breast cancer**, still 100% ER+, 20% PR+, **Her2 negative**. The treatment with ***Letrozole*** was continued for almost **2 years**.

As a result, ***Letrozole*** was discontinued and she was put on ***Faslodex*** and ***Ibrance***. Since Sarah was already suffering from osteoporosis, therefore, the doctor started ***Xgeva***. Sarah was given ***Xgeva***, as an injection under the skin, after every **four weeks** but it made her feel miserable for several days. The most side effects that Sarah experienced after having ***Xgeva***shots **were jaw pain, shortness of breath and unusual muscle or bone pain.**

Within **3 months**, the only cancer evident on CT scans was an 8 mm lesion in her thoracic spine. Sarah was able to stay on the highest dose of ***Ibrance*** for about **11 months**. Scans remained stable and her liver function tests also returned to normal. Even **transaminases** normalized after **3 months**. Her **alk phos** levels also dropped to 128 after two months and they continued to show a considerable decrease over the next **two months**. ***Faslodex***, ***Ibrance*** and***Xgeva*** were continued for more than a year.

The doctor told Sarah that the hot flashes and menopausal-like symptoms were due to hormone therapy (***Letrozole***followed by ***Faslodex***). Although, Sarah had shown great progress with ***Ibrance***, she experienced some side effects as well. These side effects included some **hair thinning, fever and mild fatigue**.

Moreover, it was observed that **both her platelet counts and white blood cell counts (especially neutrophils) had lowered**. ***Ibrance*** also elevated liver enzymes. Sarah managed to stay on ***Ibrance*** for **11 months** and avoided bone marrow toxicity. She had a reduced dose of ***Ibrance*** 100 mg.

Her isoenzymes were elevated for liver, bone, and intestine in **2015**, but after treatment with ***Letrozole, Ibrance, Faslodex and Xgeva***, there was a tremendous decrease in her isoenzymes levels in **2018**. Sarah is really happy now to have a normal alk phos and she is even hopeful that the normal value means her bone disease is stable and dormant.

Apart from the aggressive cancer treatment, Sarah was also prescribed to have a healthy and balanced diet, with **fruits and vegetables and yogurt**. The diet itself made Sarah feel a whole lot better.

The entire experience of going through the treatment was really difficult not only for her but also for her entire family. Sometimes, she would be really depressed and on some days the pain would be unbearable. But she had her family by her side to support her emotionally.

emomooney,1530521416,"Hi. 

So, I found this out yesterday, I'm pretty poor at emotions and the like. So I mostly just shut down. I feel selfish. I am pretty scared. So far we don't really know anything, just that she has surgery on Thursday and will probably be home by Sat, and then we wait two weeks for results from that before knowing what the plan is with chemo and radiotherapy. 

I know everyone's recovery is different, but I really think she is trying to soften it for us, which I understand. Telling me to just be around on Saturday and then go back home on Sunday. I feel like this is a massive surgery, she is getting reconstruction done at the same time. I just want to be realistic and be able to take the time off work ( I live a few hours away and can't drive ) to be able to care for her. It is likely that she won't be able to do anything at all for about 4 - 6 weeks right? She is fit and healthy in general. 

Has anyone gone through this? What should I expect, obviously making food, taking care of house things that is all pretty clear to me. But other things, will she be able to move at all? Will she be able to walk up stairs? I feel like we kind of know what to expect with chemo, but I think the recovery from the surgery is going to worse than we expect. "

Jtrem714,1593975299,"Originally, posted about my wife's diagnoses here back in January. 

The initial scans showed that she had 3 suspected lymph nodes (Both via PET/CT and Ultrasound) The Main mass was biopsied and was high-grade Triple negative. However, no biopsy on the nodes. 

After 6 founds of AC chemo with Taxotere. 

She underwent a Single Mastectomy with Sentinel node biopsy.

Good news all 4 nodes removed during the surgery were negative. However, the main mass remained at the same size 4cm total. 

The surgeon was able to get clear margins all the way around. No impact on chest wall muscle what so ever. 

Now here is where we are getting the confusion. The oncologist isn't recommending Radiation. Since there is no impact on the nodes according to the biopsy during the mastectomy. 

However, we had a consultation with the Radiation Oncologist and they are pushing to do radiation given that they suspected impact on the lymph nodes during the initial diagnoses and the fact that the main tumor still remained and was high grade. 

Anything, I have researched showed no benefits with doing radiation on node-negative mastectomy with a tumor under 5cm total and with clear margins. 

In this case who wins out? My wife and I are confused and wondering if we should seek another opinion on the matter with another Radiation Oncologist."

IamMalkiYah,1539976559,"Hello, 

My name is MalkiYah and I am a photographer in the Metropolitan Detroit (Michigan, USA) area. The saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" can be so true. So I have been drawn to do some ""Photography Series Projects that will say a thousand words!

I am doing a series on physical scars on women. Why am I doing that? Because society determines a woman's beauty by her physical appearance and if she has any flaws she is devalued in some way. I empathize because even as a man I experienced a bit of that after my motorcycle accident in 2004. The scars from my bike landing on my right leg and then being drugged for 50 yards, get a certain look when people see them when I'm wearing shorts; you should have seen my leg before it healed . So I can just imagine what a woman goes through when she has a mastectomy, surgery or injury that causes her to have a major scar.

So how does this tie into my photography series? My mother had a double mastectomy and I remember distinctly her saying one day, ""so I lost my breasts, that's not going to stop me from living!"" I want to help women overcome that feeling that, that scar has taken their beauty! I want them to know that their beauty is so much deeper!

That is what this Photo Series will convey. 

So I am looking for women who live in the Southeast Michigan area that want to model displaying their scars to the world, proving that they have overcome the emotional &amp; psychological prison that the world places before them. If you are interested or knows someone interested in modeling (over 18 years old) please contact me @ iammalkiyah@gmail.com."

First time I‚Äôve felt beautiful in months. However, when I removed them and took off the liner (I used magnetic lashes), I pulled off a bunch of my natural lashes too. 

I loved the look of the false lashes, but I don‚Äôt want to cause additional damage to my natural lashes. Does anyone have any tips? I‚Äôm thinking about eyelash extensions but I worry about the damage with that too.

makeupismySO,1519112945,"I was diagnosed with stage 3 IDC about a month ago. I have started chemo (DD AC-T) and I will have my last chemo session in May. My tumour is quite large, and my doctor has let me know that even if the adjuvant chemo is very effective, due to the cancer affecting the skin on my breast, a mastectomy is essentially guaranteed. 

I am fairly large chested (I wear a 36DDD) and regardless of the type of reconstruction I receive, my unaffected breast will need to be reduced. My question is: should I opt for a single mastectomy combined with reconstruction/reduction, or instead have a double mastectomy in hopes of a more symmetrical reconstruction? 

I‚Äôve never been particularly fond of my breasts. They‚Äôre large and they swell for days before I get my period and my nipples are annoyingly sensitive. I am childfree, so I‚Äôll never need to breastfeed anything. Given my lack of attachment (metaphorically!) to my breasts, which option is likely to give me the most symmetrical/aesthetically pleasing  results? I‚Äôve looked for pictures of results of both approaches online, but I was hoping to get some personal experiences as well. My doctor is leaning more towards a single mastectomy combined with DIEP flap, but I‚Äôm just not sure I‚Äôll like the results. 

Has anyone else faced this choice?"

Ne0nLights,1535470158,"Short hand info: I found a lump a couple months ago, had a biopsy about a month ago, came back with benign breast conditions noted. Now the breast that was biopsied has swollen up and is hot to the touch and I'm worried it's not responding fast enough to antibiotics.  


Longer stuff:  
Has anyone had a core biopsy and had trouble healing after? I'm trying to be as positive as possible, but after a very tough time learning that I have benign conditions and family history that apparently predisposes me to higher risk of breast cancer, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by what seems to be a secondary infection. About a week ago (maybe two, tops?) I noticed that my biopsied breast was warm to the touch and swollen. For the first couple weeks I left it alone as much as I could, though maybe I handled it too much, and I thought it was healing. I noticed my armpit was swollen as well, and my normally insensitive nipple suddenly had more feeling on that side. No redness, and the bruises healed up, but the pain and heat coupled with the swelling made it uncomfortable at best and painful at worst. I tried to stay calm, and went to a massage therapist last Friday thinking perhaps I'd been overworking and just strained my shoulder, as it is my dominant arm and I use it to work for several hours a day. She gave me a lymph massage, which helped drain it, but also noted it felt just like the mastitis her sister had while breastfeeding. I am not breastfeeding, nor am I pregnant, or having kids. So off I went to a GP yesterday, who prescribed me a course of antibiotics. She told me hormones sometimes cause fibroadenomas and seemed confused when I told her the technicians vaguely told me I had three out of nowhere, adenosis, apocrine metaplasia and haven't started any new birth control. I have not been on any hormonal medication in ten years. I just want to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a day in to my antibiotics course, and honestly, I'm not noticing changes. I think I'm a little less swollen in my armpit, but my breast is noticeably a bit larger, and still warm, firm, heavy and tender to the touch. I'm trying not to freak out, but I don't know exactly what to do... is this anywhere in the realm of normal? Could my breast just be finicky and still healing? Even scarier... what can I even DO if it doesn't respond to antibiotics?  


This is my first time finding breast lumps, my first biopsy, my first true realization that my risk factors are so high. I still want to go for genetic testing soon, but I'm broke, unemployed and having trouble working due to this. I live abroad and I am not eligible for unemployment or many government sponsored healthcare programs. It's terrifying, still. I'm trying not to let my mind reel, but everything I've read is about IBC and how infection is 'uncommon.' Even more frustrating, my gynecologist doesn't seem to have cared one shred about my email detailing this... I mean really, it's a month away from the biopsy and still causing me notable trouble, surely that's something to be aware of? She hasn't responded. I feel so alone.  


I don't know why this has been so hard, I'm just trying to stay positive and not assume the worst. I really hope in the next few days the antibiotics help, this has been such a painful couple months in an emotional and physical way. Thank you to anyone who listened, hoping everyone here is having a calm day."

WIPCorgi,1540250284,"My mother had an abnormality on her mammogram (after skipping them for four years... ugh) and got an ultrasound today. They found a 1cm thing and the radiologist told her at the apt. that it's ""probably cancer"" and scheduled a biopsy. What are the odds it's not? Kind of a long shot to hope but it seems strange to make that announcement before a biopsy. Thanks"
BrokenAshcraft,1586656688,"I had a 3d mam and an ultrasound on my right breast.

The radiologist said he thinks its a fat containing lesion but wants a biopsy. Birads 4

I have just a few questions!

1. How do you know taller than wide by feeling? Mine feels diagonal, from my nipple going towards my armpit but at a downward angle. Palpable and close to surface with no pain.

2. I've had this lump for 2 years and was told 2 years ago after ultrasound it was just dense breast tissue. Wouldn't it be obvious cancer by now if it was cancer?

3. Everything I've read says fat lesions are hyperechoic. How were your masses defined?"
statusconference,1595646409,"My previous post discussed the merits of no surgery v surgery to prevent very high risk of breast cancer. I've been talking it over with my mum a bit recently and am leaning more towards getting the surgery done, but have loads of questions. I'll have to have a chat with my breast specialist at the clinic and the surgeon, but thought I might be able to learn more here.

Has anyone here waited to have the surgery until they had lost weight? I'm currently obese and need to lose at least 25kg, which I would hope to lose before the surgery. I have weighed far less than I currently do at various points in my life, and would rather not go through something like that while also dragging all this weight around.

Has anyone had the double mastectomy and reconstruction done either simultaneously or fairly close together? How long did it take you to recover? 

If you had quite some time between the mastectomy and reconstruction, how much time did you have to wait?

For anyone who has had the mastectomy and reconstruction, does the hospital provide physical therapy assistance? I was reading earlier that you can't lift anything for weeks or your arms over your head for weeks. How do you wash your hair? What did you do for exercise?

What were the financial repercussions like? I am extremely fortunate to have landed within the Australian public healthcare system where it's going to cost me nothing, but I worry about the recovery time. If I have to take 6-12 weeks off work, I will have to plan accordingly. At what point did you return to work, if you worked in an office job?

What was your mental health like afterwards and during the recovery process? How did you deal with it all? Was it a fairly isolating experience, or did you have enough supports?

Thanks in advance for reading and anyone who answers any of the questions!"
BirthControlMethods,1589508570," HOW DO THEY TEST A BIOPSY FOR CANCER? HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DO A BIOPSY OF THE BREAST?

 What is a biopsy?

The term ""biopsy,"" of course, does not apply only to the breast. It is a surgical procedure in which a part (incisional biopsy) or all (excisional biopsy) of any tumor, growth, cyst, flesh, or organ anywhere in the body is removed so that its nature may be determined by microscopic examination. The results of this examination, called the pathology report, indicate the exact diagnosis and help select the proper method of treatment, which may be further surgery, X-ray treatment, drug administration or no treatment at all.

PurpleLadybug_6,1586741561,"One of my best friends was diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer recently. She opted for a mastectomy and underwent surgery about a month ago. Everything went well and her prognosis is wonderful--no chemo or radiation, and her doctor expects a full recovery.

However, she's still spending most of her time in bed, and that worries me. She's never been a bundle of energy, but from what she tells me, she's barely moving from her bedroom. She's taking a lot of pain medication and sleeps a lot during the day. I don't know if she's depressed or too dependent on the pain meds or something else. 

I've tried talking to her, but she's never been very open. Right now, because of stay-at-home orders, it's just her and her husband. He's a wonderful man, but not very good about addressing problems. He's also working from home to try to keep their health insurance.

Any advice on what I can do or say to my friend? Or should I stay out of it, keep in touch with her and see if she reaches out to me?

I am 19F, no known health problems, and on 90-Day Birth Control (Daysee). I have no family history of breast cancer. 

About a year ago I noticed a lump in the upper right part of my right breast. I was concerned at first, but knew that with no family history and my young age with no other symptoms it was highly unlikely that there was any true concern. I have no other lumps that feel abnormal on either breasts. 

Now, a year later I have noticed the same lump again, but it is larger. I wasn‚Äôt actively feeling for it when I noticed it. Maybe the size of a small plum?  Fairly hard and sore to the touch. 

I have no other symptoms other than occasionally I will get sores on that same right breast but that could be nothing? 

I am a college student out-of-state so finding healthcare can be a struggle, but I am absolutely willing to seek medical professionals if this is a true concern that should be addressed and looked at."

danguje,1592507352,"Hello,

I'm new to this forum but need some support. I just found out today that my mom's few rounds of taxol didn't work and that her tumors have been growing for the past 3-4 months. She has Triple Negative, Stage 4 Breast Cancer. I'm heartbroken as I quickly read up on the next treatment (eribulen), and it doesn't seem like it extends her life very much. She's in pain and has been adamantly trying to avoid neuropathy by wearing her ice packs during chemo, but apparently eribulen causes it as well. 

I just wish she could live so much longer. I want my baby to know her as he gets older. I can't help but to be overwhelmed with sadness right now. I had so much hope that taxol (chemo) was working. She said she might have even been able to feel it working and had a good feeling. I have modeled my life after her, she's my inspiration. I'm also heartbroken that I have to leave in a month for 5 months for mandatory job training. What can I do to get over my grief and help her to live her happiest life? Will she be miserable on this treatment?"
